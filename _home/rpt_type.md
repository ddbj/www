# Controlled vocabulary for /rpt\_type qualifier

The original site; [Controlled vocabulary for /rpt\_type qualifier](http://www.insdc.org/controlled-vocabulary-rpttype-qualifier) 2015.11.11 version.

This page contains the current definition, format and controlled
vocabularly for repeat type qualifier.

``` code
Qualifier: /rpt_type=
Definition: organization of repeated sequence 
Value format: tandem, inverted, flanking, terminal, direct, dispersed, and other
Example: /rpt_type=INVERTED 
Comment: the values are case-insensitive, i.e. both "INVERTED" and "inverted" are valid;
```

## Definitions of the values:

  - tandem:  
    a repeat that consists of two or more adjacent copies of a region whose length is greater than one in the same orientation;
  - inverted:  
    a repeat pair occurring in reverse orientation to one another on the same molecule;
  - flanking:  
    a repeat lying outside the sequence for which it has functional significance (eg. transposon insertion target sites);
  - terminal:  
    a repeat at the ends of and within the sequence for which it has functional significance other than long terminal repeat;
  - direct:  
    a repeat where the same sequence is repeated in the same direction;
  - dispersed:  
    a repeat that is located at dispersed sites in the genome;
  - *nested:*  
    a repeat that is disrupted by the insertion of another element;
  - *long\_terminal\_repeat:*  
    a sequence directly repeated at both ends of a defined sequence, of the sort typically found in retroviruses (replaces LTR Feature Key);
  - *non\_ltr\_retrotransposon\_polymeric\_tract:*  
    a polymeric tract, such as poly(dA), within a non LTR retrotransposon;
  - *x\_element\_combinatorial\_repeat:*  
    a repeat region located between the X element and the telomere or adjacent Y' element;
  - *y\_prime\_element:*  
    a repeat region located adjacent to telomeric repeats or X element combinatorial repeats, either as a single copy or tandem repeat of two to four copies;
  - *telomeric\_repeat:*  
    a repeat region found within the telomere;
  - *centromeric\_repeat:*  
    a repeat region found within the modular centromere;
  - other:  
    a repeat exhibiting important attributes that cannot be described by other values.
