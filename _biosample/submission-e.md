To submit a BioSample, enter content from left to right tabs.

For BioSample information fields, please see the [BioSample information fields](/biosample/sample-info-e.html).

{% include image.html url="books/hbs-02.jpg" caption="Submit new samples" class="w450" %}

Select a sample type in the "SAMPLE TYPE". 

In the "SAMPLE TYPE", select an appropriate package according to the type of sample or sequence. Enter required and optional sample attributes provided by a selected package.

### Missing value reporting  {#missing-value-reporting}

[The International Nucleotide Database Collaboration (INSDC)](https://www.insdc.org/submitting-standards/missing-value-reporting) have developed a standardised missing/null value reporting language to be used where a value of an expected format for sample information reporting can not be provided. Submitters are strongly encouraged to always provide true values of expected formats. In cases where this information cannot be provided (e.g., pathogen samples for which this information would lead to identifiability of a human) or is not relevant (e.g., study of a model organism lab stock or an established cell line), it is recommended to declare an appropriate exemption using one of the reporting level terms of the extended INSDC "missing value" reporting standards (e.g. "missing: control sample"). If these reporting level terms are not appropriate, enter "missing", "not collected" or "not provided".

To facilitate an understanding of the supported terms we enclose a table with the missing/null value terms and their definitions.

Please use the following standardised missing value vocabulary only if a true value of an expected format for a mandatory field is missing. If a true value is missing for a recommended or an optional field then these fields should not be used for reporting at all.

INSDC missing value reporting terms ([INSDC website](https://www.insdc.org/submitting-standards/missing-value-reporting))

### Sample attributes validation  {#validation}

Upload the sample attribute file by selecting the file and click the Continue button. The validator checks the uploaded file accoring to the rules and feedbacks the error and warning messages. Submitters can not submit the BioSample unless all errors are resolved.

For validation rules and messages, please see [Validation rules page](/biosample/validation-e.html).

In the following packages, at least one of attributes is required. For example, strain or isolate is mandatory in the Microbe package.  
In the BioSample submission tsv, required attributes are marked with "*", however, at least one required attributes are not marked.  

| Package | 'either-one-mandatory' attributes | 'either-one-mandatory' attributes |
|---|
| Microbe | strain, isolate | isolation_source, host |
| Model.organism.animal | strain, isolate, breed, cultivar, ecotype | age, dev_stage |
| Metagenome.environmental | isolation_source, host ||
| Invertebrate | isolate, breed | isolation_source, host |
| Plant | isolate, cultivar, ecotype | age, dev_stage |
| Virus | host, lab_host ||
| Beta-lactamase | strain, isolate ||
| Pathogen.cl | strain, isolate ||
| Pathogen.env | strain, isolate ||

Check content in the last "OVERVIEW" and submit samples. In the "ATTRIBUTES" area, the submitted sample attribute file can be downloaded.

## Accession numbers  {#accession-numbers}

When creating a new submission, a temporary ID starts with SSUB is assigned. The DDBJ BioSample issues accession numbers with prefix SAMD to the submitted samples passed validation. When an unregistered organism is described in the organism or the locus_tag_prefix has values, accession numbers are issued after curator review. You can view status and accession numbers of submitted samples in your [submission account](https://ddbj.nig.ac.jp/D-way/).

<div class="attention">
- Do NOT cite a temporary ID starts with SSUB in references.
- Do not double submit the samples which have been registered to EBI and NCBI.
</div>

## Release of BioSample {#sample-release} 

You can select the following options. Hold date cannot be set for BioSample.

- Release immediately following curation
- Release when referenced data is published

The submitted sample data can be kept private. Sample data are automatically released when the linked DDBJ/DRA/GEA/MetaboBank record(s) is published. The release of the BioSample record does not trigger the release of private DDBJ/DRA/GEA/MetaboBank record(s) referencing this BioSample accession. The release of the BioSample record does trigger the release of referencing BioSample in derived_from attributes.

FAQ: [How are linked BioProject/BioSample/sequence data released?](/faq/en/bp-bs-seq-release.html)

## Update BioSample  {#update-biosample}

Registered samples can be updated. Please inform us points to be updated through the [contact form](/contact-ddbj-e.html) so that we will update the samples. If you want to update sample attributes, please attach the updated attribute tsv file to the email replying to the accession number notification email. You can download the attribute tsv file at D-way.
