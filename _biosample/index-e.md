[The BioSample database](/biosample/index-e.html) was developed to serve as a central location in which to capture and store descriptive information about the biological source materials, or samples, used to generate experimental data in any of DDBJâ€™s primary data archives. Typical examples of a BioSample include a cell line, a primary tissue biopsy, an individual organism, or an environmental isolate.

The data are shared among [DDBJ](../index-e.html), [EBI](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biosamples/) and [NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/biosample) BioSample databases; all sample information in one of these databases will also be held in the other database.

The general aims of this project include:

-   Allowing submitters to explicitly indicate when the same samples have been used across multiple studies.
-   to provide a submission portal that promotes the use of controlled vocabularies for sample attributes, thus helping to harmonize sample descriptions across databases.
-   to link samples to corresponding experimental data in multiple archival databases, making it possible for users to aggregate all available data derived from a given sample.
