[The BioSample database](/biosample/index-e.html) was developed to serve as a central location in which to capture and store descriptive information about the biological source materials, or samples, used to generate experimental data in any of DDBJâ€™s primary data archives. Typical examples of a BioSample include a cell line, a primary tissue biopsy, an individual organism, or an environmental isolate.

The data are shared among DDBJ, [EBI](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biosamples/) and [NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/biosample) BioSample databases; all sample information in one of these databases will also be held in the other database.
