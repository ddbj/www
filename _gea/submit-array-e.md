## GEA submission flow  {#gea-submission-flow}

### 1. Obtain a submission account {#account}

- Create a [D-way submission account](https://ddbj.nig.ac.jp/D-way/).
- To enable GEA submission, [register a public key to your account](/account-e.html#public-key).

### 2. Register a BioProject and BioSample(s) {#bioproject-biosample}

#### [BioProject](/bioproject/submission-e.html)  {#BioProject}

- A description of the reseach effort.

#### [BioSample](/biosample/submission-e.html) <img src="/assets/images/parts/tsv.png" alt="" title="" class="tsv">  {#BioSample}

- A description of biologically or physically unique samples used to generate experimental data.

<img src="/assets/images/parts/tsv.png" alt="" title="" class="tsv">
metadata can be submitted as a tab-delimited text file.

### 3. Upload raw and processed data files {#upload}

- Upload raw and processed data files into the GEA submission directory.
- \[Optional\] When an array design is not available in [ArrayExpress](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biostudies/arrayexpress/studies?query=type%3Aarray)/GEA, upload an array design file into the GEA submission directory along with data files.

### 4. Select a BioProject and BioSample(s) {#select-bp-bs}

- Select a registed BioProject for the GEA submission.
- Select registed BioSample(s) for the GEA submission. Majority of GEA submissions require more than one sample.

### 5. Prepare IDF and SDRF {#create-idf-sdrf}

#### IDF  {#idf}

- The [IDF (Investigation Description Format)](/gea/metadata-e.html#idf) file is used to give an overview of the experiment, including the experimental design, protocols and publication information.

#### SDRF  <img src="/assets/images/parts/tsv.png" alt="" title="" class="tsv"> {#SDRF}

- The [SDRF (Sample and Data Relationship Format)](/gea/metadata-e.html#sdrf) describes the sample characteristics and the relationship between samples, arrays, data files etc.
- SDRF template is generated from selected BioProject and BioSample(s). Enter additional information.

### 6. Submit IDF, SDRF and validate data files {#validation}

- After submitting IDF and SDRF in the submission web system, [validation](/gea/validation-e.html) of the uploaded data files will automatically begin.
- The submission passed validation will be reviewed.

## Pre-submission checklist  {#checklist}

### Two-color microarray experiment {#two-color}

At the moment GEA submission interface only supports one type of two-color workflow ([see graphic here](/gea/example-e.html#sdrf_example2)), where two samples are connected with one common raw data file, which includes both channels.
If you select the dual-channel option in the IDF tab, it will expect that you provide one file for the two samples that were hybridized together. Some recent two-color microarray technologies generate two separate raw data files (usually one for each channel), which will cause validation to fail (if you connect a single file per sample).

If you have separate files for each channel, please [contact GEA team](/contact-ddbj-e.html).

### Single-cell sequencing experiment {#single-cell}

Refer to [ArrayExpress Single-cell submission guide](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/help/single-cell_submission_guide.html).
Please [contact GEA team](/contact-ddbj-e.html) to upload any additional files for custom spike-ins or to facilitate data analysis.

### More than one technology per experiment {#technologies}

GEA will ask you for the technology and name of the array, and applies it to the whole submission. If you have used different types of technologies for the same set of samples, we ask you to create separate submissions. Please make sure that the submissions have distinct titles (even though they may belong to the same study), in order to avoid mistakes. If you have samples from more than one array design in your experiment, it is possible to submit only one experiment. If you wish to do this, please [contact GEA team](/contact-ddbj-e.html).

## Microarray experiment submission  {#array-sub}

### Create a new submission  {#create-new-submission}

Login [D-way](https://ddbj.nig.ac.jp/D-way/) and the top page is displayed. Move to the GEA submission site from the "GEA" menu at the top.

Create a new microarray experiment submission by selecting "Microarray" and clicking the \[New submission\]. At the same time, in the DDBJ file server (ftp-private.ddbj.nig.ac.jp), a corresponding subdirectory is created under the submitterâ€™s GEA upload directory. [Upload data files to this subdirectory](#upload-data).

<div class="attention">
If there is no reply from submitters after three months of initial contact, submissions will be cancelled.
</div>

<div class="attention">
The maximum number of assay per submission is 1,000. If you have more than 1,000 assays, please create multiple submissions with the same BioProject reference.
</div>

#### md5 checksum {#checksum}

GEA uses [md5 checksum values](#supplement-md5) to detect corruption of files.  
When there are many files or you are familiar with command line, provide output of [md5sum command](#supplement-md5) as a separate file with the filename \<GEA submission ID\>.md5 (for example, ESUB000001.md5) and upload it along with the data files. Values of the .md5 file are used over those of the SDRF.

Example: ESUB000001.md5 (checksum values and filenames are delimited by two spaces)

### Overview and submit  {#submit}

You can download the IDF and SDRF files and check them. When correction is necessary, go back to the previous tab and corrent metadata.

Submit the IDF and SDRF metadata by clicking the "Submit" button.


{% include image.html url="books/array-overview.jpg" caption="Check the IDF and SDRF and submit" class="w450" %}


### Validation  {#validation-step}

When data files described in the IDF and SDRF are not found in the submission directory, an error message "Data file is not uploaded" is shown and the submission is aborted.

The validator checks submitted IDF and SDRF files according to the [validation rules](/gea/validation-e.html) and gives warning and error messages. Errors need to be resolved for submission.


{% include image.html url="books/array-validation.jpg" caption="Warning and error messages" class="w500" %}


### Accession number  {#accession}

[GEA accession numbers](/gea/overview-e.html#acc) are issued to completed GEA experiment.

You can allow reviewers access to private records by [communicating a reviewer accesss token](/gea/reviewer-access-e.html).
