## Third-party reanalysis data submission  {#third-party}

If you have performed reanalysis of sample data that were submitted to GEA or INSDC by researchers other than yourself, you can create an experiment record that links these samples; it is not necessary for you to resubmit the sample data. Such third-party reanalysis experiment records can only be accepted if all the referenced data (including raw data, like fastq files) are publicly available in GEA or INSDC, and the intent is to publish the findings and experiment accession number in a peer-reviewed manuscript that describes the reanalysis. Please [contact GEA staff](/contact-ddbj-e.html) and they will assist with submission of your third-party reanalysis experiment.

### Notes on the GEA third-party reanalysis data submission  {#req-third-party}

- To release third-party reanalysis GEA data, a peer-reviewed manuscript that describes the reanalysis should be published.
- The all data (including raw data, like fastq files) referenced in the third-party GEA data should be publicly available in major public databases including GEA and INSDC.
