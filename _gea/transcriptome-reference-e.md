Even though organisms whose reference genome sequences are not available, transcripts abundance data can be obtained conveniently by analyzing RNA-seq reads as transcript sequences assembled from the reads. This page decribes how to submit such expression data.

## Expression data {#expression}

Submit genes or transcripts expression data (counts) as [processed data files](/gea/datafile-e.html#seq_proc) of GEA. 
Please relate genes and transcripts with IDs of public resources such as RefSeq/Ensembl/INSDC.

## Transcriptome Shotgun Assembly {#tsa}

Please consider to submit assembled transcripts sequences to DDBJ [Transcriptome Shotgun Assembly (TSA)](/ddbj/tsa-e.html). 
Gene annotation is not required for TSA. Sequences assembled from samples can be submitted as single set of [TSA](/ddbj/tsa-e.html) sequences.
