Even though organisms whose reference sequences are not available, gene expression data can be obtained by aligning RNA-seq reads to transctiptome de novo assemblies.  
This page decribes how to submit such gene expression data.

## Gene expression data {#expression}

Submit gene or contig expression data (counts) as [processed data files](/gea/datafile-e.html#seq_proc) of GEA. 
Please include a table describing relationships between contigs and genes, or RefSeq/Ensembl IDs, in processed data files.

## Transcriptome Shotgun Assembly {#tsa}

Please consider to submit assembled transcriptome sequences to DDBJ [Transcriptome Shotgun Assembly (TSA)](/ddbj/tsa-e.html). 
Gene annotation is not required for TSA. A set of assemblies from samples can be submitted as single set of [TSA](/ddbj/tsa-e.html) sequences.
