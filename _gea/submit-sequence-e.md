## Pre-submission checklist {#checklist}

### Single-cell sequencing experiment {#single-cell}

Refer to [Single-cell submission guide](/gea/single-cell-e.html). Please [contact GEA team](/contact-ddbj-e.html) to upload any additional files for custom spike-ins or to facilitate data analysis.

### More than one technology per experiment {#technologies}

GEA will ask you for the technology and name of the array, and applies it to the whole submission. If you have used different types of technologies for the same set of samples, we ask you to create separate submissions. Please make sure that the submissions have distinct titles (even though they may belong to the same study), in order to avoid mistakes. If you have samples from more than one array design in your experiment, it is possible to submit only one experiment. If you wish to do this, please [contact GEA team](/contact-ddbj-e.html).

## Sequencing data submission {#seq-sub}

### Create a new submission {#create-new-submission}

Login [D-way](https://ddbj.nig.ac.jp/D-way/) and navigate to the GEA submission page from the top menu.  
Create a new microarray experiment submission by selecting "Sequencing" and clicking [New submission]. At the same time, in the DDBJ file server (ftp-private.ddbj.nig.ac.jp), a corresponding subdirectory is created under the submitterâ€™s GEA upload directory. [Upload data files to this subdirectory](#upload-data).

<div class="attention">
The maximum number of assay per submission is 1,000. If you have more than 1,000 assays, please create multiple submissions with the same BioProject reference.
</div>

### IDF {#idf-tab}

Enter information for [IDF (Investigation Description Format)](/gea/metadata-e.html#idf). [Example IDF](/gea/example-e.html#idf).

- Protocol: Pre-checked protocols are mandatory.
- Publication: Describe associated publications by PubMed ID or DOI. For unpublished manuscript, please [inform us](/contact-ddbj-e.html) the ID after assignment.
- Data File Type: Processed data files are required for sequencing experiment submission. [Accepted Data Files Formats for sequencing experiment](/gea/datafile-e.html#seq_data). We strongly recommend to submitting processed data file per sample.

- Derived Array Data File and Comment[Derived Array Data File md5]: Enter filename and [md5 checksum](#supplement-md5) pair for each processed data file.
- A list of filename and its md5 checksum (output of [md5sum command](#supplement-md5)) can be provided as a file <GEA submission ID>.md5 (e.g., ESUB000001.md5) (when the checksum values are provided in both SDRF and .md5 file, those in the .md5 are used).
- Factor Value[enter experiment factor name here]: A user-defined name for each experimental factor studied by the experiment. These experimental factors represent the variables within the investigation (e.g. growth condition, genotype, organism part). The actual values of these variables will be listed in the "Factor Value []" columns.

{% include image.html url="books/seq-sdrf-up.jpg" caption="Select entered SDRF file" class="w450" %}

### md5 checksum {#checksum}

GEA uses [md5 checksum values](#supplement-md5) to detect corruption of files.  
When there are many files or you are familiar with command line, provide output of [md5sum command](#supplement-md5) as a separate file with the filename <GEA submission ID>.md5 (for example, ESUB000001.md5) and upload it along with the data files. Values of the .md5 file are used over those of the SDRF.

Example: ESUB000001.md5 (checksum values and filenames are delimited by two spaces)

### Overview and submit {#submit}

You can download the IDF and SDRF files and check them. When correction is necessary, go back to the previous tab and corrent metadata.   
Submit the IDF and SDRF metadata by clicking [Submit].

{% include image.html url="books/seq-submit.jpg" caption="Check the IDF and SDRF and submit" class="w450" %}

### Validation {#validation-step}

When data files described in the IDF and SDRF are not found in the submission directory, an error message "Data file is not uploaded" is shown and the submission is aborted.  
The validator checks submitted IDF and SDRF files according to the [validation rules](/gea/validation-e.html)and gives warning and error messages. Errors need to be resolved for submission.

{% include image.html url="books/seq-validation.jpg" caption="Warning and error messages" class="w500" %}

## Accession numbers {#accession}

[Accession numbers](/gea/overview-e.html#acc) are issued to the completed GEA experiment. You can allow reviewers access to private records by [communicating a reviewer accesss token](/gea/reviewer-access-e.html).
