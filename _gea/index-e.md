## Genomic Expression Archive

Genomic Expression Archive (GEA) is a public database of functional
genomics data such as gene expression, epigenetics and genotyping SNP
array. Both microarray- and sequence-based data are accepted in the
[MAGE-TAB](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/help/magetab_spec.html)
format in compliance with [MIAME](http://fged.org/projects/miame/) and
[MINSEQE](http://fged.org/projects/minseqe/) guidelines, respectively.
GEA issues [accession numbers](/gea/overview-e.html#acc), E-GEAD-n to
experiment and A-GEAD-n to array design.
