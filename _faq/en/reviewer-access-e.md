* GEA: By using the [reviewer access](/gea/reviewer-access-e.html), you can provide metadata, microarray data and NGS processed data to reviewers.
* MetaboBank: If you want to provide a reviewer access, request through [Application Form for MetaboBank Update](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeaFdelfJ2aDvmOO4YrmOk5jql5dutx4vhLuBStoqUh5779OA/viewform).
* DRA: You may send a metadata summary list attached to the accession number notification e-mail. For sequencing data, download [archived fastq files](/dra/submission-e.html#fastq-sra-files) and provide them to reviewers through access-controlled file sharing services or servers.
* DDBJ: See ["How can we show our submitted sequence in private status to reviewers?"](/faq/en/paper-show-referee-e.html).
* JGA: We can not offer the reviewer access service due to [the policy](https://humandbs.dbcls.jp/faq#faq-20).

Reviewer access services are not available in [DRA](/dra/index-e.html), [DDBJ](/ddbj/index-e.html) and [JGA](/jga/index-e.html).

For open-access databases (GEA/MetaboBank/DRA/DDBJ), if you make your data public, all users including reviewers can access the data.
