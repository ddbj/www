<p>By using <a href="/gea/reviewer-access-e.html">the GEA reviewer access</a>, you can provide metadata, microarray data and NGS processed data to reviewers.</p>
<p>Reviewer access services are not available in <a href="/dra/index-e.html">DRA</a>, <a href="/ddbj/index-e.html">DDBJ</a> and <a href="/jga/index-e.html">JGA</a>.</p>
<p>For DDBJ, see <a href="/faq/ja/paper-show-referee-e.html">'On the process of submission of a paper to a journal, we have to show the referee our nucleotide sequence submitted as "Hold-Until-Published" status'</a>.</p>
<p>For DRA, you may send a metadata summary list attached to the accession number notification e-mail. For sequencing data, download <a href="/dra/submission-e.html#fastq-sra-files">archived fastq files</a> and provide them to reviewers through access-controlled file sharing services or servers.</p>
<p>For JGA, we can not offer the reviewer access service due to <a href="https://humandbs.biosciencedbc.jp/faq#faq-20">the policy</a>.</p>
<p>For open-access GEA/DRA/DDBJ, if you make your data public, all users including reviewers can access the data.</p>
