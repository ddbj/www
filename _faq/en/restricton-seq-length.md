## Is there any restriction of sequence length to submit to DDBJ?

<dl><dt>Upper limit</dt>
  <dd>If the sequence is really observed, there is no upper limitation of the sequence length to submit to DDBJ. <br>However, we can not accept any operationally joined sequence, for example, joining chromosomes. We accept each chromosome sequence, respectively. <br>For sequences greater than 500 kbases in its length, please submit by using <a href="/ddbj/mss-e.html">Mass Submission System (MSS)</a> instead of <a href="/ddbj/web-submission-e.html">Nucleotide Sequence Submission System (NSSS)</a>. </dd><dt>Lower limit</dt>
  <dd>For minimum length, DDBJ has no systematic restriction, however, when the sequence is less than 20 bp in its length, our system outputs "warning" to your data. <br>When the sequence has biological significance, even if it is a short sequence, DDBJ accepts the submission of it. However, we consider that more than fifteen bases would be required to describe something in general, such as full length of small RNA transcript, some of specific tag sequence and so on. </dd>
