See "[Why is the hold-date required?](/insdc/data-release-policy-e.html#requirement)". Please specify the date.    
Though DDBJ does not restrict the date, we strongly recommend to specify the date within two years.    
If not specified, the data will be published, immediately. 

After data submission, you can change the hold date as needed.     
Contact us from [this form](/ddbj/update-form-e.html) by selecting "Change the hold-date" in [Subject].
