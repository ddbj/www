For ancient DNA samples, the location and date reported depends on when the sample was collected with the intention of sequencing.
If the sample was from a museum, the location of the museum and time of collection should be provided. This indicates the sample collection event with the intention of sequencing. In this case, if known, the original geographic location and original collection date can optionally also be provided.
If the sample was from an archaeological site, the location of the site and the time of that collection event should be provided.
