For ancient DNA samples, the location and date to be reported depend on what information is important to interpret the sequencing data from the samples. If the original geographic location and original collection date are known and important to interpret the data, provide these information. If the sample was from a museum and the location of the museum and time of collection are important to interpret the data, enter these location and time. If relevant information does not exist, enter one of [the missing values](/biosample/submission-e.html#missing-value-reporting), e.g. "not collected".
