**[What is data type?](/documents/data-categories-e.html)**

In case of either *1 or *2, please take following steps before MSS submission.
: Please register your project information in [BioProject Database](/bioproject/index-e.html) to get BioProject ID.
: Please register biological source materials used in experimental assays in [BioSample Database](/biosample/index-e.html) to get BioSample ID.

In case of *2, please also do the following procedure.
: complete genome or draft genome with feature annotation, you also have to get a [locus tag prefix](/ddbj/locus_tag-e.html) through BioProject submission.
: However, even though complete genomes, if the genome sequences are relatively small like as viruses, phages, organelles or plasmids only (i.e without chromosomes), you do not need to get BioProject ID.
