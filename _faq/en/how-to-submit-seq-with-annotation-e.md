Select from following two ways. 
- [DDBJ Nucleotide Sequence Submission System](/ddbj/web-submission-e.html): an interactive application to enter all of items via web form
- [Mass Submission System (MSS)](/ddbj/mss-e.html): to send submission files to DDBJ, directly

In general, we recommend to use DDBJ Nucleotide Sequence Submission System    
In cases of, large number of sequences, many features, and/or long sequences, MSS is more useful.
