Select from following two ways.    
- [DDBJ Nucleotide Sequence Submission System](/ddbj/web-submission-e.html ) (NSSS): an interactive application to enter all of items via web form
- [Mass Submission System](/ddbj/mss-e.html ) (MSS): to send submission files to DDBJ, directly

In general, we recommend to use NSSS.    
However, since NSSS can not accept all types of sequence data, it may be required to use MSS for your data submission.  
See [Workflow of the data submission to DDBJ](/ddbj/submission-e.html#workflow )
