If you want to release your data, specify DDBJ/DRA/GEA/MetaboBank accession numbers to be released. When only BioProject accession is informed, only the BioProject record is released and related data are not released. Similarly, when only BioSample accession is informed, only the BioSample record is released and related data are not released.    
DDBJ/DRA/GEA/MetaboBank data release triggers relase of referencing BioProject and BioSample.
