<p>When there are many Experiment and Run objects, create metadata XMLs by using the excel for the DRA metadata and the XML generator. The metadata can be registered by uploading the Submission/Experiment/Run XMLs in D-way. Please see <a href="https://github.com/ddbj/submission-excel2xml">the GitHub page</a> for details.</p>
