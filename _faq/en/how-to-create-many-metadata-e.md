When there are many Experiment and Run objects, create metadata XMLs by
using the excel for the DRA metadata and the XML generator. The metadata
can be registered by uploading the Submission/Experiment/Run XMLs in
D-way. Please see [the GitHub
page](https://github.com/ddbj/submission-excel2xml) for details.
