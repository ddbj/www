Confirm the following points.

- Authentification is by using SSH key not by password.
- A private key is pair of a public key registered in a D-way account. [Manual](/account-e.html#public-key)
- Make sure to specify a private key for authentification and not a private key for dataset encryption/decryption. [Manual](/jga/download-e.html#data-use-approval-download)
- A private key file has read permission.
- A private key file permission is set as others cannot access. For example, rw-------.
- A passphrase for private key is correctly entered.
- The ssh connection with the port number 443 is allowed in your network (Please ask your network administrator)

When transferring data files by using a private key generated in the other operating system, please check format of a private key. [Convert private key](/account-e.html#convert-private-key)

- In Unix/Mac OS X: Convert a key in the Windows PuTTY file format into the OpenSSH.
- In Windows WinSCP: Convert a key in the Unix/Mac OS X OpenSSH file format into the Windows PuTTY format.

When these are correct, because we do not support technical details regarding use of third-party softwares, please refer to websites of softwares or confirm your system administrators whether ssh (in the case of JGA, port 443) is allowed or not.
