DDBJ can not accept only assembled EST sequences. However, DDBJ can accept EST assembled sequences as [TSA](/ddbj/tsa-e.html) with original (i.e. before assemble) sequence data. See also [Data Submission form Transcriptome Project](/ddbj/transcriptome-e.html).    
When original sequence data (primary entries) are generated from Next Generation Sequencers, submit to [DDBJ sequence Read Archive (DRA)](/dra/index-e.html), from traditional sequencers, submit as [EST](/ddbj/est-e.html) via [Mass Submission System (MSS)](/ddbj/mss-e.html).    
Then, DDBJ can accept assembled sequences (both *de novo* and reference mapping) as TSA through MSS.
