## Do I need to make a separate BioProject for every type of data?

<p>No, you do not. You should organize your BioProjects the most appropriate way for your research effort.</p>
<p>From <a href="/news/en/2014-11-12-e.html">12 November 2014</a>, multiple <a href="/bioproject/services/index.html#Project_data_type">Project data types</a> can be selected for a project in the submission system.</p>
<p>To merge genome sequencing and transcriptome analysis projects, select both 'Genome Sequencing' and 'Transcriptome or Gene Expression' for the <a href="/bioproject/services/index.html#Project_data_type">Project data type</a>. One material is allowed for the <a href="/bioproject/services/index.html#Material">Material</a>, so select 'Other'.</p>
<p>Another way is to register 'Genome Sequencing' and 'Transcriptome or Gene Expression' as separate projects and unite them by an <a href="/bioproject/services/index.html#Use_an_umbrella_project">Umbrella BioProject</a>.</p>
