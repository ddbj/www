## Our company would like to use Pipeline for commercial purposes. May we do so? If so, will the confidentiality of sequence information be guaranteed?

There is nothing wrong with using DDBJ Pipeline for research and development purposes. However, please refrain from routinely incorporating the service into commercial endeavors, such as analyses that your company may be hired to perform on a contract basis. Regarding security, your data cannot be seen by other users; however, note with caution that other users will be able to see file names unless you rename them using the GUI settings. In addition, results are subject to volume restrictions and are deleted after 60 days. After this time period, you must repeat the analysis.
