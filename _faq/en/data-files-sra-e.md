Uploaded data files are processed per Run. All files under a Run are
merged into single [binary SRA
file](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/docs/sra-data-formats/)
by using [SRA
toolkit](http://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/sra.cgi?view=toolkit_doc).
During this conversion, length and format of all reads are checked.

Read names are editted and identifiers (DRR accession number + serial
number) are automatically inserted ([example:
DRR000001](http://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/?view=run_browser&run=DRR000001)).  
Original read names should be unique in a Run.  
A DRR accession number is used as a filename. If the
[fastq](/dra/metadata-e.html#File_Type) is selected for the filetype, 
read names are replaced with the DRR accession number + serial number. ([example:
DRR030615](http://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/?view=run_browser&run=DRR030615)).

When "PAIRED" is selected in Experiment, paired reads are grouped in a Run.

DRA generates fastq from SRA files by using [SRA toolkit](http://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/sra.cgi?view=toolkit_doc) 
and provide sequencing data in both file formats.

More than two fastq files are provided for paired reads. Paired reads
are divided into a file with "_1" (example, DRR000001_1.fastq.bz2) and
"_2" (example, DRR000001_2.fastq.bz2). Reads without pair are provided
in a file without "_1" nor "_2" (example, DRR000001.fastq.bz2).
