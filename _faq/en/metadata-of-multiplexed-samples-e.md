Barcoded data files should be demultiplexed prior to submission and a unique BioSample should be created for each barcoded sample; in other words, each BioSample must be linked to one or more unique data files.    
If necessary, describe relationship between barcode sequences and samples in the [Library Construction Protocol](/dra/metadata-e.html#Library_Construction_Protocol) of Experiment as free-text.

Regarding 10x Genomics data in which samples tend to be large number, 
please see the GEA [Single-cell submission guide](/gea/single-cell-e.html).

For details, see [Data Files](/dra/datafile-e.html).
