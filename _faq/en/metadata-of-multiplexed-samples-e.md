Divide sequence data files per sample and submit each file as single BioSample-Experiment-Run set. If you need to describe the relationship between barcode sequence and sample, please describe in the [Library Construction Protocol of Experiment](/dra/submission.html#Library_Construction_Protocol) as free-text.
