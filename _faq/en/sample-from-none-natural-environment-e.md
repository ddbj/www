For species originating elsewhere to where the sample was physically collected for sequencing e.g. species in a museum, zoo, aquaculture, botanic garden or farm, the collection location is still useful information and the collection date and geographic location (country and/or sea) provided should reflect the collection event when the sample was collected for sequencing purposes. This means that for these kinds of samples, the location of the museum, zoo, aquaculture, botanic garden or farm should be provided. In these cases, if there is a known origin elsewhere, submitters should also report the origin of the sample with the fields original geographic location and original collection date.
