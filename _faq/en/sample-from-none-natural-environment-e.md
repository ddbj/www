For species originating elsewhere to where the sample was originally collected e.g. species in a museum, zoo, aquaculture, botanic garden or farm, describe the collection location which is useful to interpret the sequencing data obtained from the sample. If the museum, zoo, aquaculture, botanic garden or farm are important to interpret the data, enter these locations. If not, enter the location of origin. Treat the collection date in a similar manner.
