The E value is computed using the following formula, in which l denotes
the length of the query string, n denotes the number of strings stored
in the database, and S is a score that measures the homology between
nucleic acids or between amino acids. Note that k and m are positive
constants.  
E=k\*l\*n\*exp^(ÔºçmS)  
If the BLAST output results computed using this formula are displayed in
the form 1E-X, this means that the quantity has the value
10<sup>-X</sup>.
