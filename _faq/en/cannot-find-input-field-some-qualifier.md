## Can not find input field for some qualifier

<p>Click <strong>[Select Qualifier]</strong>, check qualifiers in the dialog as needed and click [Save] button. <br>Then, you can find input fields for qualifiers on <a href="/ddbj/websub-help-e.html#flow-7">7.Annotation</a>. </p>
<p>Related to this issue, in case of selecting "other" on <a href="/ddbj/websub-help-e.html#flow-6">6. template</a>, you have to specify some features other than source. So, click <strong>[Add feature]</strong> and select some feature on the list. </p>
