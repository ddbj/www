## How long are the temporal differences of data releases among DDBJ, EMBL-Bank and GenBank?

<p>In general, the data released from EMBL-Bank or GenBank are loaded into DDBJ services and published from DDBJ within their released date. <br>The data released from DDBJ are loaded into ENA/EBI and GenBank and published from them within a few days. <br>However, the data release processes at all three databases may be delayed, because of system maintenance, troubles on the network, or any other reasons. So, we can not specify the temporal differences among them. </p>
