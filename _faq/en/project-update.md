<p>At this time, it is necessary for submitters to <a href="/contact-ddbj-e.html">contact the BioProject team</a> to request updates and withdrawals as necessary. Please note that when BioProjects are updated, the submission overview page in the D-way submission portal will not reflect this change. That page is only a record of the initial submission, and does not display changes made in the BioProject database.</p>
