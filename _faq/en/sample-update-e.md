It is necessary for submitters [to contact the BioSample team](/contact-ddbj-e.html) to request updates and withdrawals as necessary. 
You can confirm updated samples by downloding the [attribute tsv](/submission.html#update-biosample) (example, SSUB000001.txt) in the ATTRIBUTES of the D-way BiSample submission page.
