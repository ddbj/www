At this time, it is necessary for submitters [to contact the BioSample team](/contact-ddbj-e.html) to request updates and withdrawals as necessary. 

Please note that when BioSamples are updated, the submission overview page in the D-way submission portal will not reflect this change.    
That page is only a record of the initial submission, and does not display changes made in the BioSample database.
