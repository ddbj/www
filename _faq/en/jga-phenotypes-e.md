In the JGA submission, fields including the Subject ID and Gender are required.    
Specifically, that the main variable (e.g., heart disease) and co-variates (e.g., age, weight) used in the analysis are submitted to JGA so that other people can reproduce the information in your publication.    
The goal is to include the data that would be required for another researcher to be able to reproduce the published analysis.
