<p><a href="/ddbj/websub-e.html">Nucleotide Sequence Submission System</a> is an interactive application to enter all of items required for your submission on step by step basis. <br>To use <a href="/ddbj/mss-e.html">Mass Submission System (MSS)</a>, submitters have to make submission files by themselves. So, DDBJ will review and consult for submitters on the process of making files. <br>Some submitters use Nucleotide Sequence Submission System to submit a lot of sequences, while some submitter use MSS to submit a few sequences. <br>Based on above information, select either of them as needed. </p>
