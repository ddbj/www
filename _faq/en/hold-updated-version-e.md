DDBJ does not accept any reservation for updating sequence data.  
Therefore, in case of updating published data, the data will be
immediately re-distributed after update.

Please select either of following ways.

  - In this time, canceling the request for update, when you can publish
    updated data, contact us again.
  - Submit the updated data as a new data with [hold
    date](/ddbj/submission.html#holddate). When the new data is
    published, the accession number of the old data will become a
    secondary accession number for the new data.  
    \# Please inform us during submitting the new data to link it to the
    old data.
