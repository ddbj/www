In cases of sequences derived by direct molecular isolation from soil, sea water, etc. i.e. a bulk environmental DNA sample by PCR with or without subsequent cloning of the product, DGGE, or other anonymous methods, see [What is ENV ? â€“ environmental samples](/ddbj/env-e.html).    
For description of [organism qualifier](/ddbj/organism-e.html), see [3. Environmental samples](/ddbj/organism-e.html#env). 

Though frequently confused, <span style="color: #ff0000; font-weight:bold">the term, 'environmental samples', does NOT mean "wild type". </span> If sequences are derived from isolated or cultured organisms, the sequence data are not classified into environmental samples.
