It indicates that this data is directly submitted from the submitter. The term is the antonym to "journal scan".    
[REFERENCE 1](/ddbj/flat-file-e.html#Reference1B) is the information of submitter(s), not general reference.    
So, do not describe "Direct Submission" in the title for literature in [REFERENCE 2](/ddbj/flat-file-e.html#Reference2B) or after.
