You should report the collection date in the format year-month-day followed by the time in ISO8601 standard format. Collection times must be in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). You should report the country and the region in an related field. For example:

* geo_loc_name (or /country) = Japan:Shizuoka
* collection date = 2023-05-05T05:12:55
