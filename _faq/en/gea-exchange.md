## Do GEA, ArrayExpress and GEO exchange data?

<p>Mutual data exchange between <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/">NCBI GEO</a> and <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/">ArrayExpress</a> is not realized so GEA data are not shared with GEO. ArrayExpress had been imported GEO data, however, this import was suspended.</p>
<p>BioProject and BioSample registered during GEA submission are exchanged with NCBI/EBI in the framework of INSDC.</p>
