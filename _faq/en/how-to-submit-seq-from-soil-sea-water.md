## How to submit sequence data directly obtained from soil or sea water?

<p>In cases of sequences derived by direct molecular isolation from soil, sea water, etc. i.e. a bulk environmental DNA sample by PCR with or without subsequent cloning of the product, DGGE, or other anonymous methods, see <a href=\"/ddbj/env-e.html\">What is ENV ? â€“ environmental samples</a>. <br>For description of <a href=\"/ddbj/organism-e.html\">organism qualifier</a>, see <a href=\"/ddbj/organism-e.html#env\">3. Environmental samples</a>. </p><p>Though frequently confused, <span style=\"color: #ff0000; font-weight:bold\">the term, 'environmental samples', does NOT mean \"wild type\". </span> If sequences are derived from isolated or cultured organisms, the sequence data are not classified into environmental samples. </p>
