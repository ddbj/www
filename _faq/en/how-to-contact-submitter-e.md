Since 2007, we have removed E-mail addresses and phone numbers from
sequence data.  
If you can find a related paper at [REFERENCE](/ddbj/flat-file-e.html#Reference2B) on [DDBJ flat file](/ddbj/flat-file-e.html), contact information would be available on the paper.  
When you wishes to contact to the submitter(s) of an entry of your interest, please select “Inquiry to the sequence submitters” in [Contact](https://forms.gle/ZXteuEPM4SSm5HUt8) with reasons briefly, then we will forward your message to the submitter(s).
