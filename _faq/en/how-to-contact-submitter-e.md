Since 2007, we have [removed E-mail addresses and phone numbers from
sequence data](/ddbj/flat-file-e.html#submitter-info).  
If you can find a related paper at
[REFERENCE](/ddbj/flat-file-e.html#Reference2B) on [DDBJ flat
file](/ddbj/flat-file-e.html), contact information would be available on
the paper.  
When you wishes to contact to the submitter(s) of an entry of your
interest, please contact us via [Inquiry to the sequence submitters
(submitted to DDBJ)](/contact-ddbj-e.html#to-submitters) with reasons
briefly, then we will forward your message to the submitter(s).
