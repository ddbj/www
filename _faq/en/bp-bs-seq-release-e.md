Linked [BioProject](/bioproject/index-e.html), [BioSample](/biosample/index-e.html), [DDBJ](/ddbj/submission.html), [DRA](/dra/index-e.html), [GEA](/gea/index-e.html) and [MetaboBank](/metabobank/index-e.html) data are released as follows.

- Release of the BioProject and BioSample records DO NOT trigger release of the other linked data.
- Release of the BioSample records trigger release of the referencing BioSample in derived_from attributes.
- Release of the DDBJ, DRA, GEA and MetaboBank data DO trigger release of the linked BioProject and BioSample records.
- Release of DDBJ triggers release of DRA Run(s) linked from DBLINK(s).
- Release of GEA triggers release of linked DRA Run(s).
- Release of the DRA data DO NOT trigger release of the DDBJ records.

<p class="attention">All metadata and sequencing data in a DRA submission are released at once.</p>
