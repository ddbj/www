## Do we have to submit sequence data to DDBJ, when the journal has no requirement to do so?

<p>Though there is no requirement to submit sequence data to DDBJ (, EMBL-Bank or GenBank) on the journal, we strongly recommend to submit sequence data to DDBJ for improvement of data availability for readers of your paper. </p>
