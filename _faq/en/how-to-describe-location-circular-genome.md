## In a circular genome, when a feature is located in the base range joined from the last base to the first base, how to describe the location of the feature?

<p>For instance, when the length of sequence is 199035 bp and a CDS feature is located in the range from 199001 to 100, you should describe the location of CDS feature as <br> join(199001..199035,1..100)<br>See also <a href="/ddbj/location-e.html">Description of Location</a> in detail. </p>
