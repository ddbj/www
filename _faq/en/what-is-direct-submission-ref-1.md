## What is "Direct Submission" in TITLE of REFERENCE 1?

<p>It indicates that this data is directly submitted from the submitter. The term is the antonym to "journal scan". <br><a href="/ddbj/flat-file-e.html#Reference1B">REFERENCE 1</a> is the information of submitter(s), not general reference. <br>So, do not describe "Direct Submission" in the title for literature in <a href="/ddbj/flat-file-e.html#Reference2B">REFERENCE 2</a> or after. </p>
