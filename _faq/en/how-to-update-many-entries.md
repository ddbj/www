## How to update many entries with a number of corrections?

<p>If you are making update request for large number of entries, or many changes of features/locations/qualifiers due to sequence modification, see followings.</p>
<dl><dt>(1) Update information is in common of all entries.</dt>
  <dd>Example: change reference or submitters information, postpone the hold-date, etc..</dd>
</dl>
<p>In principle, send your request via <a href="/ddbj/update-form-e.html">Application Form for Data Update Requests</a>. </p>
<p> </p>
<dl><dt>(2) Contents of corrections are different among entries. </dt>
  <dd>Example: change each clone or gene name of all entries, etc..</dd><dt>(3) Extensive correction of data</dt>
  <dd>Example: change more than 30 features due to the sequence update, etc..</dd>
</dl>
