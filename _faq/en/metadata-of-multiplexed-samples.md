## How should I describe a pooled sample distinguished by barcode sequences in metadata?

<p>Divide sequence data files per sample and submit each file as single BioSample-Experiment-Run set. If you need to describe the relationship between barcode sequence and sample, please describe in the <a href="/dra/submission.html#Library_Construction_Protocol">Library Construction Protocol of Experiment</a> as free-text.</p>
