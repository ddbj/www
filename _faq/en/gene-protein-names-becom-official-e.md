DDBJ does not have any right for the gene nomenclature. Also, DDBJ does
not make any official collaboration with any committee of gene
nomenclature. If there is no particular incident, the descriptions
related to gene nomenclature are described as provided by submitter.  
Even if you name a gene during your sequence data submission to DDBJ,
there is no guarantee that the gene name is accepted at research
communities.

You should confirm each gene nomenclature committee, i.e. [HUGO Gene
Nomenclature Committee (HGNC)](http://www.genenames.org/) for human,
[MGI - Mouse
Nomenclature](http://www.informatics.jax.org/mgihome/nomen/index.shtml#mnrg)
for mouse, and so on.
