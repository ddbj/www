No, typically, it is appropriate to cite the accession numbers that are assigned to your data submissions, e.g. the DDBJ nucleotide sequence or DRA Run accession numbers.

If an individual BioSample needs to be referenced, state that "BioSample metadata are available in the DDBJ BioSample database under accession number SAMDxxxxxxxx".
