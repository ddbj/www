## Though I am not the original submitter of the sequence data, can I correct an error in the data?

<p>In principle, DDBJ only accepts updating requests from <a href="/ddbj/submission.html#terms">the original submitter</a> of the entry except reference update.  Therefore, if you are not the submitter you will need authorization from the submitter before making requests for the entry. <br>DDBJ can forward your comments and suggestions to the submitter. <br>Please contact us via <a href="/contact-ddbj-e.html#to-submitter">Inquiry to the sequence submitters (submitted to DDBJ)</a>. </p>
