## The files that I uploaded using FTP are not reflected on the Web.

Files uploaded to the FTP server are automatically transferred to a specific directory on the National Institute of Genetics (NIG) supercomputer after the upload is complete. Thus, it is normal for files to appear to have vanished after uploading.
