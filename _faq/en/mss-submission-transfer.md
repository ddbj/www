<p>In such case, please inform us your D-way account. Then, the submission files can be transferred to a sub directory (usually named ‚Äùmass") under your D-way account by scp (<a href="/ddbj/mss-e.html#File_transfer">File transfer</a>). Please visit the <a href="/dra/submission-e.html#dra-data-submission">"Data submission to DRA"</a> for how to create a D-way account, if you do not have an account.</p>
