## How do I interpret the search results?

Search results are displayed in the following order.
<ol>
  <li>Precedence table of sequences with high homology scores</li>
  <li>Homologous sequences and their alignment</li>
  <li>Parameters and statistics</li>
</ol>Note that the symbol “|” in the BLAST search results for nucleotide sequences indicates agreement between nucleotide sequences. For amino-acid sequences, matching amino acids will be displayed. The symbol “+” is used to indicate similarities between amino acids. <br><br>For further details, refer the original papers on BLAST.<br><br><a href="/blast-e.html#reference">BLAST Reference</a>
