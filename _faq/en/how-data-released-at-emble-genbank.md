## How are the data released from DDBJ published at EMBL-Bank, GenBank?

<p>DDBJ is functioning as one of <a href="/insdc-e.html">the international nucleotide sequence databases</a>, including EMBL-Bank/EBI in Europe and GenBank/NCBI in the USA as the two other members. <br>When DDBJ releases the submitted data, EMBL-Bank and GenBank will load the data into their own services, respectively. <br>See <a href="/ddbj/submission.html#data_flow">Sequence Data Transition</a>. <br>Note that the data are converted into EMBL-Bank or GenBank format. </p>
