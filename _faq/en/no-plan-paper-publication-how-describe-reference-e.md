Regardless you are to publish academic paper or not, DDBJ accepts your submission of sequence data.    
If you have no plan to paper publication, you have to fill following items of REFERENCE. 
 - status: [Unpublished]
 - year: tentative year (this year), i.e. 2014 
 - title: tentative title to explain your data 
 - ab_name (authors): abbreviation of tentative author(s) (often the same as ab_name of SUBMITTER) 

When you change your plan after sequence data submission, i.e. if you publish a paper, contact us from [this form](/ddbj/update-form-e.html) to send request with subject "Our paper was published".
