You can use [Mass Submission System](/ddbj/mss-e.html) (MSS) not only for many sequences but also for one long sequence with many features (i.e. complete genome with annotation).    
There is no limit of the number of sequences to use MSS and, in some cases, it is required to use of MSS by factors other than the number of sequences.    
Use [Submission navigation](/submission-navigation-e.html ).     
See [Workflow of the data submission to DDBJ](/ddbj/submission-e.html#workflow )
