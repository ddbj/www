## Do I have to register a separate BioProject/BioSample for each genome I am sequencing?

<p>If multiple cultured genomes are part of the same research effort, then they can belong to the same BioProject. However, each culture must be registered as a separate BioSample.</p>
<p>Metagenomic assemblies, where multiple genomes are assembled with high confidence from a single metagenomic sample, register a BioProject for metagenomic assembly project, and BioSamples for each sample of metagenomic assembly. </p>
