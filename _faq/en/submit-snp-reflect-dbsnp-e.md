SNP data submitted to [DDBJ](/ddbj/index-e.html) is not reflected in [dbSNP](https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/).   
For information on the submission format to DDBJ, please refer to the [Description Examples of Sequence Data](/ddbj/example-e.html), [section F: Variation](/ddbj/example-e.html#F), as well as [Representative submissions of identical sequences for variation studies](/ddbj/representative-sequence-e.html).   

[TogoVar-repository](/togovar/index-e.html) accepts human SNP data. Although data exchange with the NCBI [dbSNP](https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/) is planned, it has not yet been implemented. Therefore, SNP data registered to TogoVar-repository are not reflected in dbSNP.   
Please also refer to FAQ "[Where to submit variant data, such as Single Nucleotide Variants (SNVs), Copy Number Variants (CNVs) and structural variants?](/faq/en/where-to-submit-variation-data-e.html)"
