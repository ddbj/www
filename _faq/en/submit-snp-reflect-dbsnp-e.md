Though you can submit sequence data including SNP (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms) to DDBJ, the data will not automatically reflect to dbSNP.    
[dbSNP](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/) is an independent database from [INSDC](/about/insdc-e.html), operated by NCBI.    
For SNP data, we recommend you to submit to dbSNP. 

In case of submission to DDBJ, see format of feature annotation at [B13) polymorphism and variation](/ddbj/example-e.html#B13) on [Example of Submission](/ddbj/example-e.html).
