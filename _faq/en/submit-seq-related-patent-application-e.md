Nucleotide sequence data related to patent applications are transferred from Japan Patent Office to DDBJ.     
So, usually, you do not have to submit such sequence data to DDBJ. 

However, if you apply to any other Patent Office, or if you need to publish a paper during patent application, confirm at Patent Office whether you can submit the data to DDBJ or not. 

Note that when the sequence data is published from DDBJ, the data becomes a part of the public domain, as "official notice".
