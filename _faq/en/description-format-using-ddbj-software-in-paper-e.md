The format differs from journal to
journal; please ask the publisher.     
In your publications, please cite the
original papers for the appropriate tools and state that you used DDBJ
software for searching and analyzing gene sequence data.  
  
Please see the DDBJ home page [References](/services/references-e.html)
about the original papers and other related papers on the DDBJ search
and analysis software.
