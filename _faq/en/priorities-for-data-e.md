If you submit nucleotide sequence data to DDBJ, you can get <font color="#ff0000">NO priority</font> for the data.    
DDBJ takes no responsibility for any property or priority issues for patenting. For patent application, you should confirm [JPO](https://www.jpo.go.jp/e/index.html) or some other Patent Offices.
