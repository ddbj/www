We recognise there may be valid exemptions for this which are included for [missing value reporting](/biosample/submission-e.html#missing-value-reporting). For example, you may have collected a control sample from a collection instrument to sequence a negative control. In this case, the location of where you collected that control is not applicable to report as it was prepared in a lab but you could report the date in which you collected the control sample.

In this case, you would report:

* geo_loc_name (or /country) = missing: control sample
* collection date = 2020-05-25
