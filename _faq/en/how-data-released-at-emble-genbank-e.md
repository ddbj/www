DDBJ is functioning as one of [the international nucleotide sequence
databases](/about/insdc-e.html), including EMBL-Bank/EBI in Europe and
GenBank/NCBI in the USA as the two other members.  
When DDBJ releases the submitted data, EMBL-Bank and GenBank will load
the data into their own services, respectively.  
See [Sequence Data Transition](/ddbj/submission-e.html#data_flow).  
Note that the data are converted into EMBL-Bank or GenBank format.
