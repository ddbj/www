## Data registered for DRA under the [Import Public DRA tab] cannot be imported.

From the “Import Public DRA”, tab it is possible to select data that have already been released by DRA; however, at present, the system is not equipped with functionality to fetch unreleased data, even data previously registered within DRA, into Pipeline. We regret this inconvenience; please use FTP to upload the data to the Pipeline server, separately from DRA.
