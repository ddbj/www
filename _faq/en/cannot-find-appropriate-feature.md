## Can not find appropriate feature key

<p>See <a href="/ddbj/features-e.html">Definition of Feature Key</a> and <a href="/ddbj/full_index-e.html">Feature Table Definition</a>. <br>When you can not find any accommodated feature, use <a href="/ddbj/features-e.html#misc_feature">misc_feature</a> and enter information in value of /<a href="/ddbj/qualifiers-e.html#note">note</a> qualifier. </p>
<p>For instance, since DDBJ is a database for nucleotide sequences, we do not prepare any specific item for amino acid sequence motifs. <br>However, you can describe such kind of information by using misc_feature with /note qualifier. </p>
