## How do I update my BioSample?

<p>At this time, it is necessary for submitters <a href="/contact-ddbj-e.html">to contact the BioSample team</a> to request updates and withdrawals as necessary. Please note that when BioSamples are updated, the submission overview page in the D-way submission portal will not reflect this change. That page is only a record of the initial submission, and does not display changes made in the BioSample database.</p>
