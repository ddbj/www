## Is it OK to submit sequence data by only one submitter?

<p>DDBJ accepts updating requests only from the original submitter of the entry. <br>Basically, we strongly recommend to describe joint submitters more than two persons, e.g. at least a true worker and an adviser, to avoid lost communication in future. </p>
<p>See <a href="/ddbj/submission.html#item">Required items for nucleotide sequence submission</a>. </p>
