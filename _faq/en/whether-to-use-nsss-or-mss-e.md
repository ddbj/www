[Nucleotide Sequence Submission System](/ddbj/web-submission-e.html) is an interactive application to enter all of items required for your submission on step by step basis.    
To use [Mass Submission System (MSS)](/ddbj/mss-e.html), submitters have to make submission files by themselves. So, DDBJ will review and consult for submitters on the process of making files.    
Some submitters use Nucleotide Sequence Submission System to submit a lot of sequences, while some submitter use MSS to submit a few sequences.    
Based on above information, select either of them as needed.
