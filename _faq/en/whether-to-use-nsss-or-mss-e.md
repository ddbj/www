[Nucleotide Sequence Submission System](/ddbj/web-submission-e.html) is an interactive application to enter all of items required for your submission on step by step basis.    
To use [Mass Submission System (MSS)](/ddbj/mss-e.html), submitters have to make submission files by themselves.    
The Nucleotide Sequence Submission System can not accept all types of sequence data.  See [Nucleotide Sequence Submission](/ddbj/submission-e.html#accept ).    
Based on above information, select either of them as needed.
