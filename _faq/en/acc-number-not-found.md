## I entered an accession number that is shown in the DRA Search display in the [Import Public DRA tab], but I got an error message saying that the number was not found.

Within Pipeline, the displayed list of accession numbers is obtained from the list released by NCBI. This list may differ in some places from the list released by DDBJ. If you receive an error message saying that the item in question was not found, please contact us. We will take care of the problem. (pipeline_dev@ddbj.nig.ac.jp)
