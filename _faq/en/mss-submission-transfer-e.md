In such case, please inform us your D-way account.    
Then, the submission files can be transferred to a sub directory (usually named ‚Äùmass") under your D-way account by scp ([File transfer](/ddbj/mss-e.html#File_transfer)).    
Please visit the ["Data submission to DRA"](/dra/submission-e.html#dra-data-submission) for how to create a D-way account, if you do not have an account.
