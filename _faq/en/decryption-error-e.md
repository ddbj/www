If you decrypt JGA data by using a PuTTY-format private key, an "Unable to load Private Key" error will be shown.    
[Convert a PuTTY-format private key into an OpenSSH-format key](/account-e.html#convert-private-key) and use the OpenSSH-format private key.    
Both OpenSSH and PuTTY format public keys can be registered in data use applications, you do not need to convert the registered public key format.
