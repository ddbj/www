In principle, DDBJ only accepts updating requests from (/ddbj/submission.html#terms)[the original submitter] of the entry except reference update.  Therefore, if you are not the submitter you will need authorization from the submitter before making requests for the entry.    
DDBJ can forward your comments and suggestions to the submitter. 

Please contact us via [Inquiry to the sequence submitters (submitted to DDBJ)](/contact-ddbj-e.html#to-submitter).
