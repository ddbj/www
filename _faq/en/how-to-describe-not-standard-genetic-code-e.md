At first, please confirm whether [The Genetic
Code](/ddbj/geneticcode-e.html) is appropriately selected or not.  
Generally, if [/transl\_table](/ddbj/qualifiers-e.html#transl_table)
qualifier is appropriately described with a number of the genetic code,
the nucleotide sequence is automatically translated to amino acid
sequence according to the genetic code.

In exceptional cases of specific codons (selenocysteine etc.) that is
not followed the genetic codes, describe
/[transl\_except](/ddbj/qualifiers-e.html#transl_except) qualifier,
appropriately.

In cases of [RNA editing，](/ddbj/example-e.html#B09)[ribosomal
frameshift](/ddbj/example-e.html#B10)，[mitochondrial TAA stop
codon](/ddbj/example-e.html#B11), see [Example of
submission](/ddbj/example-e.html) and describe with
/[exception](/ddbj/qualifiers-e.html#exception) and
/[translation](/ddbj/qualifiers-e.html#translation),
/[ribosomal\_slippage](/ddbj/qualifiers-e.html#ribosomal_slippage),
/[transl\_except](/ddbj/qualifiers-e.html#transl_except), respectively.

In case of rare initiation of translation, staring with an amino acid
other than methionine, describe the [location](/ddbj/location-e.html) of
CDS feature with starting from "\<", operatively indicating 5'end not
complete. And describe brief explanation about the translation mechanism
in /[note](/ddbj/qualifiers-e.html#note) qualifier.
