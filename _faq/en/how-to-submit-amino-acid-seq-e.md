In general, you can submit amino acid sequences by describing [CDS feature](/ddbj/cds-e.html) for your nucleotide sequences.    
However, DDBJ does not accept amino acid sequences only, i.e. without any nucleotide sequences.    
In that case, please submit to [UniProt](http://www.uniprot.org/), directly.    
You can submit amino acid sequences to UniProt through [SPIN](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/swissprot/Submissions/spin/account/login).    
Please contact to datasubs@ebi.ac.uk.
