<p>In general, you can submit amino acid sequences by describing <a href="/ddbj/cds-e.html">CDS feature</a> for your nucleotide sequences. <br>However, DDBJ does not accept amino acid sequences only, i.e. without any nucleotide sequences. <br>In that case, please submit to <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/">UniProt</a>, directly. <br>You can submit amino acid sequences to UniProt through <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/swissprot/Submissions/spin/account/login">SPIN</a>. <br>Please contact to datasubs@ebi.ac.uk. </p>
