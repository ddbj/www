See [Categories for Sequence Data](/documents/data-categories-e.html).    
Please submit raw reads generated from Next Generation Sequencers to [DDBJ sequence Read Archive](/dra/index-e.html).    
See also [Data Submission from Genome Project](/ddbj/genome-e.html) or [Data Submission from Transcriptome Project](/ddbj/transcriptome-e.html).    
Please submit assembled sequences through [Mass Submission System](/ddbj/mss-e.html), if necessary.
