Please login to the [submission system](https://ddbj.nig.ac.jp/D-way/)
and change the date.    
You can set the hold date for a maximum of 4 years,
and this date may be brought forward or pushed back at any time.

We will send you an e-mail reminder 30 days before the scheduled release
date, inviting you to postpone the release date as necessary.    
Please see the video tutorial.
