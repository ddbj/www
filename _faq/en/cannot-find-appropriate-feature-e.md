See [Definition of Feature Key](/ddbj/features-e.html) and [Feature
Table Definition](/ddbj/feature-table-e.html).  
When you can not find any accommodated feature, use
[misc\_feature](/ddbj/features-e.html#misc_feature) and enter
information in value of /[note](/ddbj/qualifiers-e.html#note) qualifier.

For instance, since DDBJ is a database for nucleotide sequences, we do
not prepare any specific item for amino acid sequence motifs.  
However, you can describe such kind of information by using
misc\_feature with /note qualifier.
