Yes you can. It ought to be required at 'instructions to authors' of most of journals to submit sequence data to DDBJ (, EMBL-Bank or GanBank) before the paper submission.    
During submission of sequence data, select status for your REFERENCE as follows. 
- "Unpublished"; In cases of preparing paper, during paper submission, or you do not prepare any publication. 
- "In Press"; When your paper is accepted and in press. 

Your citations will be appeared at [REFERENCE 2](/ddbj/flat-file-e.html#Reference2B) or after on [DDBJ flat file](/ddbj/flat-file-e.html).
