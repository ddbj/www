Click **\[Select Qualifier\]**, check qualifiers in the dialog as needed
and click \[Save\] button.  
Then, you can find input fields for qualifiers on
[7.Annotation](/ddbj/web-submission-help-e.html#flow-7).

Related to this issue, in case of selecting "other" on [6.
template](/ddbj/web-submission-help-e.html#flow-6), you have to specify
some features other than source. So, click **\[Add feature\]** and
select some feature on the list.

    template)](/ddbj/web-submission-help-e.html#flow-7-2)
