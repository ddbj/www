Upper limit
: If the sequence is really observed, there is no upper limitation of the sequence length to submit to DDBJ.    
However, we can not accept any operationally joined sequence, for example, joining chromosomes.  We accept each chromosome sequence, respectively.    
For whole genome scale sequences, submit by using [Mass Submission System (MSS)](/ddbj/mss-e.html ) instead of [Nucleotide Sequence Submission System (NSSS)](/ddbj/web-submission-e.html ).    
See [Workflow of the data submission to DDBJ](/ddbj/submission-e.html#workflow )    

Lower limit
: Since June 2021, when the sequence is less than 100 bp in its length, we will refuse the sequence data submission.
