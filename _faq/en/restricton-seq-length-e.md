<dl><dt>Upper limit</dt>
  <dd>If the sequence is really observed, there is no upper limitation of the sequence length to submit to DDBJ. <br>
However, we can not accept any operationally joined sequence, for example, joining chromosomes. We accept each chromosome sequence, respectively. <br>
For sequences greater than 500 kbases in its length, please submit by using <a href="/ddbj/mss-e.html">Mass Submission System (MSS)</a> instead of <a href="/ddbj/web-submission-e.html">Nucleotide Sequence Submission System (NSSS)</a>. </dd>
<dt>Lower limit</dt>
  <dd>Since June 2021, when the sequence is less than 100 bp in its length, we will refuse the sequence data submission. </dd>
