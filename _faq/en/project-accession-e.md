<p>No, typically, you should cite the accession numbers that are assigned to your data submissions, e.g. the DDBJ, WGS or DRA accession numbers. If individual BioProjects do need to be referenced, state that "The data have been deposited with links to BioProject accession number PRJDBxxxxxx in the DDBJ BioProject database."</p>
