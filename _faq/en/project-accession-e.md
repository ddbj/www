No, typically, you should cite the accession numbers that are assigned to your data submissions, e.g. the DDBJ nucleotide sequence or DRA Run accession numbers.    
[Which accession numbers should be cited in publication?](/faq/ja/cite-accession.html)    

If an individual BioProject needs to be referenced, state that "The data have been deposited with links to BioProject accession number PRJDBxxxxxx in the DDBJ BioProject database." along with the accession numbers assigned to the data submissions.
