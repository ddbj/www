You can confirm amino acid sequences for [CDS
features](/ddbj/cds-e.html) as follows.

1. Download UME\_win.zip (for Windows) or UME\_mac.zip (for MacOSX)
from [Mass Submission System](/ddbj/mss-e.html#tool).

1. Download both annotation and sequence files at [8.
Finish](/ddbj/web-submission-help-e.html#flow-8) on DDBJ Nucleotide
Sequence Submission System.

1. [Run UME](/ddbj/ume-e.html) and load both annotation and sequence
files. Then click \[Execute\] of transChecker.

The function to confirm amino acid sequences will be applied on DDBJ
Nucleotide Sequence Submission System.
