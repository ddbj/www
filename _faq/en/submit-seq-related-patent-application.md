## Can we submit sequence data related to patent application?

<p>Nucleotide sequence data related to patent applications are transferred from Japan Patent Office to DDBJ. <br>So, usually, you do not have to submit such sequence data to DDBJ. </p>
<p>However, if you apply to any other Patent Office, or if you need to publish a paper during patent application, confirm at Patent Office whether you can submit the data to DDBJ or not. </p>
<p>Note that when the sequence data is published from DDBJ, the data becomes a part of the public domain, as "official notice". </p>
