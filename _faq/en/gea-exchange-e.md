Mutual data exchange between [NCBI
GEO](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) and
[ArrayExpress](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/) is not realized so
GEA data are not shared with GEO. ArrayExpress had been imported GEO
data, however, this import was suspended.

BioProject and BioSample registered during GEA submission are exchanged
with NCBI/EBI in the framework of INSDC.
