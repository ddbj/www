## Should I cite BioSample accession numbers in my manuscript?

<p>Typically, it is appropriate to cite the accession numbers that are assigned to your data submissions, e.g. the DDBJ, WGS or DRA accession numbers. If individual BioSamples do need to be referenced, state that \"BioSample metadata are available in the DDBJ BioSample database under accession number SAMDxxxxxxxx\".</p>
