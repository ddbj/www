For DDBJ nucleotide sequence submission system([NSSS](/ddbj/web-submission-e.html)), you must input nucleotide sequence(s) in FASTA format (for 1 sequence only) or in multi-FASTA format (for 2 or more sequences).  
Related page: [Format of the nucleotide sequences that you can paste or
upload](/ddbj/web-submission-help-e.html#flow-5-1)

You must insert the end flag (//) at the end of each sequence when you use MSS for the submission. Please see the page, ["How to Make Sequence File"](/ddbj/file-format-e.html#sequence).
