--- There are two ways of searching and
analyzing data, as discussed below. Please select the option that is
appropriate for your needs.

  - Conducting searches and analyses using a network server such as an
    FTP or web server.  
    You may access these networking tools via [Search /
    Analysis](/searches-e.html).ã€€
  - Conducting searches and analyses by logging in to the supercomputer
    system at the National Institute of Genetics (NIG).  
    (This requires a supercomputer user ID. You will need to [sign up
    for a new user account on the NIG supercomputer
    system](http://sc2.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/index.php/en/en-new-application).)
