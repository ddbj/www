The minimum requirement is the name of the ocean/sea (or country) of the collection event and date to the nearest year. In this case, as you know the ocean and the year of collection, there is no reason that you can not share these metadata. You would report:

* geo_loc_name (or /country) = Pacific Ocean
* collection_date = 2010
