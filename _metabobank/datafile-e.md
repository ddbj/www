## Mass spectrometry (MS) {#ms}

### Raw data file  {#ms-raw}

Raw data files generated by measurement platforms. 
MetaboBank accepts open standard files such as mzML as raw data files. 
Enter raw data filenames in "Raw Data File" column of SDRF. 
If there are more than one file for a sample (SDRF one row), group them by tar or zip per sample.

### Processed data file {#ms-processed} 

Analyzed data or summary on which conclusion of associated paper is based.  
Enter processed data filenames in "Processed Data File" column of SDRF. 
If there are more than one file for a sample (SDRF one row), group them by tar or zip per sample.

### Metabolite assignment file {#ms-maf} 
  
Submit information of identified metabolites in Metabolite assignment file (MAF). 
Please see [Metabolite assignment file](#maf) for details.

MS MAF excel ([download](/assets/files/submission/metabobank/MetaboBank_maf_MS.xlsx))

### Image file {#ms-image} 

For the MS imaging experiments, submit image files. 
Enter image data filenames in "Image Data File" column of SDRF. 
If there are more than one file for a sample (SDRF one row), group them by tar or zip per sample. 
Include configuration files for imaging experiments as much as possible.

## NMR {#nmr}

### Raw data file  {#nmr-raw}

Raw data files generated by measurement platforms. 
MetaboBank accepts open standard files such as nmrML as raw data files. 
Enter raw data filenames in "Raw Data File" column of SDRF. 
If there are more than one file for a sample (SDRF one row), group them by tar or zip per sample.  
Include configuration files for NNR experiments as much as possible.

### Processed data file {#nmr-processed} 

Analyzed data or summary on which conclusion of associated paper is based.  
Enter processed data filenames in "Processed Data File" column of SDRF. 
If there are more than one file for a sample (SDRF one row), group them by tar or zip per sample.

### Metabolite assignment file {#nmr-maf} 
  
Submit information of identified metabolites in Metabolite assignment file (MAF). 
Please see [Metabolite assignment file](#maf) for details.

## Metabolite assignment file {#maf}

The metabolite assignment file (MAF) is recommended to include all metabolites/unknowns/features identified or annotated within the study. Please complete the table with as much information as possible. Sample names need to be added in the columns to the right of the table, in each column sample values per metabolite should be included.  
The fixed MAF columns are as follows.
