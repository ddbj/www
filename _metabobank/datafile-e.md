## Mass spectrometry (MS) {#ms}

### Raw data file  {#ms-raw}

Raw data files outputted from measurement platforms. 
MetaboBank accepts open standard files such as mzML as raw data files. 
Enter raw data filenames in "Raw Data File" column of SDRF. 
If there are more than one data file for a sample (SDRF one row), group them by tar or zip per sample.

### Processed data file {#ms-processed} 

Analyzed data or summary on which conclusion of associated paper is based.  
Enter processed data filenames in "Processed Data File" column of SDRF. 
If there are more than one data file for a sample (SDRF one row), group them by tar or zip per sample.

### Metabolite assignment file {#ms-maf} 
  
Submit information of identified metabolites in the Metabolite assignment file (MAF). 
Please see the HELP sheet of the MAF excel for details. 
* MS MAF excel ([download](/assets/files/submission/metabobank/MetaboBank_maf_MS.xlsx))

### Image file {#ms-image} 

For the MS imaging experiments, submit image files. 
Enter image data filenames in "Image Data File" column of SDRF. 
If there are more than one image file for a sample (SDRF one row), group them by tar or zip per sample. 
Include configuration files for imaging experiments as much as possible.

## NMR {#nmr}

### Raw data file  {#nmr-raw}

Raw data files outputted from measurement platforms. 
MetaboBank accepts open standard files such as nmrML as raw data files. 
Enter raw data filenames in "Raw Data File" column of SDRF. 
If there are more than one data file for a sample (SDRF one row), group them by tar or zip per sample.  
Include configuration files for NNR experiments as much as possible.

### Processed data file {#nmr-processed} 

Analyzed data or summary on which conclusion of associated paper is based.  
Enter processed data filenames in "Processed Data File" column of SDRF. 
If there are more than one data file for a sample (SDRF one row), group them by tar or zip per sample.

### Metabolite assignment file {#nmr-maf} 
  
Submit information of identified metabolites in the Metabolite assignment file (MAF). 
Please see the HELP sheet of the MAF excel for details.
