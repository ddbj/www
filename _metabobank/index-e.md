MetaboBank is a public repository for metabolomics data obtained from mass spectrometry (MS), NMR, and imaging MS. 
Metadata are described in the MAGE-TAB format, which is standard in functional genomics ([GEA](/gea/index-e.html) and EBI [ArrayExpress](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/)) and proteomics ([SDRF-Proteomics](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-26111-3).
MAGE-TAB is also compatible with ISA-TAB used by the [MetaboLights](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/) at EBI. MetaboBank and MetaboLights collaborates in data standardization.
