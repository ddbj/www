However, E-mails sent from DDBJ are often rejected by countermeasures
against unwanted junk E-mails, because of false recognitions.

It is likely that DDBJ official E-mail addresses are "spoofed" by the
senders of junk E-mails.Unfortunately, it is required to be open to the
public our official E-mail accounts, DDBJ can not take drastic measures.

DDBJ contacts via some of E-mail addresses including the following list.
When you use services provided by DDBJ including submission, please be
sure NOT to include following E-mail addresses into the black list of

Currently, there are a lot of blocking tools against unwanted junk
E-mails, so, we can not answer the questions about each of the blocking
tools, i.e. "How to configure my client software?" and so on.

Please ask the provider of your client software or network administrator
for your domain to configure your tools.
