UME (Utilities for MSS file Error check) is a stand-alone GUI tool to check syntax and format of [Sequence file](/ddbj/file-format-e.html#sequence) and [Annotation file](/ddbj/file-format-e.html#annotation) required for using Mass Submission System of DDBJ and to check amino acid translation of [CDS feature](/ddbj/cds-e.html) based on the description of each file. UME includes both Parser and transChecker.

## Install  {#install}

Download UME package from [Validation tool for MSS data file](/ddbj/mss-tool-e.html).  
Uncompress the downloaded file to extract its contents into the UME folder.

Windows: Uncompress UME\_win.zip  
: In case of Windows, you can likely explore the files packed in zip format, directly, like as a folder. However, to run UME, all files in the UME package must be uncompressed.

unix/macOS: Uncompress UME\_unix.zip
: Extract the zipped file using a decompression program or the following command.

```
$ gunzip UME_unix.zip
```

 macOS: Regarding the available file names  
: DO NOT use multibyte character(s) for any file or folder name of [Sequence file](/ddbj/file-format-e.html#sequence), [Annotation file](/ddbj/file-format-e.html#annotation), or [AGP file](/ddbj/file-format-e.html#agp) when you use UME on some versions of macOS. UME may not work when multibyte character is included in the file or folder name.

## Initialization  {#initial}

### Starting UME  {#initial-1}

You can run UME application by double clicking the UME icon (Depending on your PC environment, some extension of UME file would be displayed) in the UME folder.

On macOS, you may not be able to run UME by double clicking the icon.  
In that case, please run UME by typing commands on Terminal window like as follows.

```
$ cd UME    # Move to directory that you have expanded UME package. 
$ ./UME.sh
```

<img src="/assets/images/ddbj/UME1-e.png" alt="Starting UME" title="" class="">

lib folder  
: Directory which includes library files used by UME.    
If you move this directory or any file in it, UME would not properly work.

resource folder  
: Directory which includes resource files used by UME.     
If you move this directory or any file in it, UME would not properly work.

sample folder  
: Including sample files for DDBJ submission.

UME file  
: Start UME application by double-clicking this file.

license file  
: A text file for license agreement. Please read at first. The contents of the file are the same as [End-user license agreement](/ddbj/mss-tool-e.html#license).

### Initial setting of UME  {#initial-2}

At the first time, you run UME application, change the maximum size of RAM for UME to optimize run-time environments.     
The default configuration of it is 512 Mbytes.     

[![](/assets/images/ddbj/UME2.png)](/assets/images/ddbj/UME2.png)
