## Controlled vocabulary for ncRNA classes

The original site; [Controlled vocabulary for ncRNA classes](http://www.insdc.org/documents/ncrna-vocabulary) 2014.02.03 version

antisense_RNA  
: RNA molecule that is transcribed from the coding, rather than the
template, strand of DNA and that is therefore complementary to mRNA.

autocatalytically_spliced_intron  
: self-splicing intron.

ribozyme  
: ribonucleic acid enzyme, RNA molecule that can catalyse specific
biochemical reactions.

hammerhead_ribozyme  
: small catalytic RNA motif that catalyzes a self-cleavage reaction.
Its name comes from its secondary structure which resembles a
carpenter's hammer. The hammerhead ribozyme is involved in the
replication of some viroid and satellite RNAs.

lncRNA  
: long non-coding RNA; such molecules are generally defined as having
a length greater than 200bp and do not fit into any other ncRNA
class.

RNase_P_RNA  
: RNA component of Ribonuclease P (RNase P), a ubiquitous
endoribonuclease.

RNase_MRP_RNA  
: RNA molecule essential for the catalytic activity of RNase MRP, an
enzymatically active ribonucleoprotein with two distinct roles in
eukaryotes. In mitochondria it plays a direct role in the initiation
of mitochondrial DNA replication, while in the nucleus it is
involved in precursor rRNA processing.

telomerase_RNA  
: RNA component of telomerase, a reverse transcriptase that
synthesises telomeric DNA.

guide_RNA  
: short 3'-uridylated RNA that can form a duplex with a stretch of
mature edited mRNA.

rasiRNA  
: small interfering RNA of length between 17 and 28 nucleotides,
derived from the transcript of a repetitive element.

scRNA  
: small cytoplasmic RNA; any one of several small cytoplasmic RNA
molecules present in the cytoplasm and (sometimes) nucleus of a
eukaryote.

siRNA  
: small RNA molecule that is the product of a longer exogenous or
endogenous double stranded RNA, which is either a bimolecular duplex
or very long hairpin, processed (via the Dicer pathway) such that
numerous siRNAs accumulate from both strands of the double stranded
RNA. sRNAs trigger the cleavage of their target molecules.

miRNA  
: small, ~22-nt, RNA molecule, termed microRNA, produced from
precursor molecules that can form local hairpin structures, which
ordinarily are processed (via the Dicer pathway) such that a single
miRNA molecule accumulates from one arm of a hairpin precursor
molecule. MicroRNAs may trigger the cleavage of their target
molecules or act as translational repressors.

piRNA  
: small RNA molecule, termed Piwi-interacting RNA, expressed in testes
and forming RNA-protein complex with Piwi protein; purification of
these complexes has revealed that Piwi-interacting RNA
oligonucleotides are approximately 24-32 nucleotides long

snoRNA  
: small [nucleolar] RNA molecules involved in modification and
processing of ribosomal RNA or transfer RNA; found in archaea and in
eukaryotic species where they are localized in the nucleolus.

snRNA  
: small nuclear RNA molecules involved in pre-mRNA splicing and
processing.

SRP_RNA  
: signal recognition particle, a universally conserved
ribonucleoprotein involved in the co-translational targeting of
proteins to membranes.

vault_RNA  
: RNA component of the vault ribonuceoprotein, a complex which
consists of a major vault protein (MVP), two minor vault proteins
(VPARP and TEP1), and several small RNA molecules and has been
suggested to be involved in drug resistance.

Y_RNA  
: component of the Ro ribonucleoprotein particle (Ro RNP), in
association with Ro60 and La proteins.

other  
: ncRNA_class not included in any other term.

ncRNA classes not yet in the INSDC ncRNA class controlled vocabulary can
be annotated by entering '/ncRNA_class="other"' with '/note="[brief
explanation of novel ncRNA_class]"'.
