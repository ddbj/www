## 2\. Hold date  {#flow-2}

Enter [Hold date](/ddbj/submission-e.html#hold-date) if you would like to suspend the release or select "Release immediately" to release right away. You cannot select the days on end or begin of the year because DDBJ suspends the work to release the nucleotide sequences during the days. The selectable hold date is limited within three years from today.

1. Click the calendar icon and select date that you intend to withhold from public view.
1. Or add the check if you would like to open the nucleotide sequence immediately.

### How to suspend/resume  {#flow-2-1}

- On or after the page, you can resume the submission from the bookmarked URL after you click "Next" even if you close the internet browser.
- While you are entering annotation in "7. Annotation" page, entered annotation is saved without clicking the "Next" button. You can resume editing annotation from the bookmarked URL.

## 3\. Submitter  {#flow-3}

Enter [submitter(s)](https://www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/ddbj/submission-e.html#submitter) on the page.

1. Contact person‘s name is automatically converted to fit the submitter’s format and shown here. You can correct the name if you need to change.
1. Click here and you can add more submitter(s). DDBJ recommend that you should include more submitters in the submission. Submitter names on actual nucleotide sequence file are displayed according to the order of this page.
1. Click "Next" after you fill the form.

<img src="/assets/images/help/NSSShelp3-1.png" alt="" title="" class="w600">

<div class="attention" markdown="1">
Please enter submitter in abbreviated format as indicated in example below.<br>

</div>

  - We would like to ask you to include two or more submitters.  
    We occasionally meet the situation where we cannot contact to the submitter in case of entries which have only one submitter. In our rule, submitter is responsible for the data and only the submitter can update own entries. Without contacting to the submitter, we cannot fulfill necessary corrections.  
    Of course, you can register your entries with only one submitter, but we recommend you to add more submitters, such as principal investigator, to your entries.

  - Entry names must be unique in one submission. If the same entry name are contained in the submission, you must correct the entry name to avoid an error.

  - Double slash (//) is not needed for separate the entries. Of course, you can include double slash (//) as a separation mark of the entries (e.g.1 & e.g.2).

  - This system automatically insert double slash (//) between entries when the nucleotide sequence that contains no double slash (//) is entered.

  - The sequence must consists of a, c, g, t, m, r, w, s, y, k, v, h, d, b, or n.

<div class="highlight">
<img src="/assets/images/help/NSSShelp7-6.png" alt="" title="" class="w600">
</div>

### Uploadable file format  {#flow-7-6-1}

  - You can [download sample annotation file from here](/assets/files/example/mtDNA.txt). You should include [biological feature](/ddbj/file-format-e.html#biological_feature) in the annotation file.

  - Please refer to ["Making MSS Files for preparation of annotation file"](/ddbj/file-format-e.html#annotation) for detail.

  - You cannot upload any one of the annotation for WGS, TSA, TLS, EST, HTC, GSS, STS, HTG, or TPA, nor the file containing DBLINK and ST_COMMENT. Please contact ["Mass Submission System (MSS)"](/ddbj/mss-e.html) to submit such submission files.

  - Information that you entered on the pages, "1. Contact person", "2. Hold date", "3. Submitter", and "4. Reference", are automatically added in front of uploaded annotation file as COMMON section.

  - When "COMMON" is included in the uploaded annotation file, it is replaced with information from "1. Contact person", "2. Hold date", "3. Submitter", and "4. Reference."

1. No need to prepare the COMMON block. The values entered in each form of "1.Contact person" - "4.Reference" are used for the actual submission even if you have included the COMMON to the annotation file.
1. You should include the biological feature to the annotation file.

### Common mistake that causes file-uploading error  {#flow-7-6-2}

  - When you use Excel for making annotation file, you need to copy it to text editor and save as the text file. The annotation file must be saved as tab-deliminated text file format.

  - Entry names of the nucleotide sequences entered at "5. Sequence" are not described in the annotation file, or order of each entry names is different between the annotation file and the nucleotide sequence.

  - The tab column structure is wrong.

  - Some extra space or illegal characters, such as multibyte, unicode, or unprintable character, are included in the file.

  - The annotation contains only source feature. Add appropriate featute(s) to the annotation.

### Error/Warning  {#flow-7-7}

  - If there are is no error after you click "Confirm", "Next" button is changed to be clickable and you can move to the next process.

  - Error/warning messages are displayed beneath annotation input area when error or warning occurred.

  - In order to correct error, please scroll-up the screen, and edit entry at which error occurred on annotation input field. Please click "Confirm" after you correct the errors.

  - When error/warning occurred at "Submitter", "Reference", or "Sequence", please go back to previous page by clicking the page name on progress bar. After correction, you must click "Next" on each page, and then click "7.Annotation" on progress bar in order to return to "7. Annotation" page.

  - "Next" button changes to be clickable, even though there are some warnings. Please check again the input data. You should correct if there are any problems. You can click "Next" if you believe that there is no problem in the input data.

For detailed error/warning messages, please refer ["validator error message"](/ddbj/validator-e.html). Add "\#JPxxxx" (xxxx = 4 digits) after the URL for direct link to each page.  
e.g. [http://www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/ddbj/validator-e.html\#JP0015](/ddbj/validator-e.html#JP0015) ... Please be patient until the page scrolls to the corresponding error number.

### How to obtain amino acid sequence  {#flow-7-8}

Please refer to the page, ["How to confirm translated amino acid sequences (i.e. /translation qualifier) for CDS features"](/faq/en/how-to-confirm-translated-amino-acid-seq-e.html).

As an alternative way, you can use the following Web services.

- [ORF finder, NCBI](//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/orffinder/)
