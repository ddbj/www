## Before you start 

  - As a first step, please read the descriptions of "[Before Submission](/ddbj/submission-e.html)" and "[Required preparation before submission](/ddbj/sequence-e.html#process)".
  - TPA:experimental and/or TPA:inferential as a small scale [TPA data](/ddbj/tpa-e.html) submission is also acceptable via this system.
  - Trim the vector or adapter regions from the nucleotide sequences. You can check it by using [VecScreen](http://ddbj.nig.ac.jp/vecscreen/).

## How to resume the submission
  - Save the bookmark after the clicking at each page. Then you can resume the submission from the bookmark.
