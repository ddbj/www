<span class="red">Submission of research data from human subjects</span>

For all data from human subjects researches submitted to DDBJ, it is submitter's responsibility to ensure that the dignity and the right of participant (human subject) is protected in accordance with all applicable laws, regulations and policies of submitter's institute.  
In principle, make sure to remove any direct personal identifiers of human subjects from your submissions.  
Before submission, read ["Submission of research data from human subjects"](/policies-e.html#submission-of-human-data).

## DDBJ Nucleotide Sequence Submission System {#NSSS}

DDBJ Nucleotide Sequence Submission System, NSSS for short, is a web-based submission tool for the assembled nucleotide sequences with appropriate annotation.

### Sequence Data to be submitted via MSS, <span class="red">NOT NSSS</span> {#MSS}

NSSS cannot accept either of the following sequence data.    
The nucleotide sequence data belonging to <span class="red">either of the following cases</span> should be submitted via [Mass Submission System (MSS)](/ddbj/mss-e.html).    
Please note the points other than number or length of your data.  

#### a) Either of the following categories or amounts of sequence data

<div class="attention" markdown="1">
- [EST](/ddbj/est-e.html), [TSA](/ddbj/tsa-e.html),
  [HTC](/ddbj/htc-e.html), [GSS](/ddbj/gss-e.html),
  [HTG](/ddbj/htg-e.html), [WGS](/ddbj/wgs-e.html),
  [TLS](/ddbj/tls-e.html)
    - See [Categories for Sequence Data](/documents/data-categories-e.html#division) in detail.
- Submission with long sequences, greater than 500 kb in its length
- Complex submission containing many features for one sequence, more than 30 features
- Submission consists of large number of sequences, greater than 100 in total
</div>

#### b) Regardless finished or draft level, sequence data of whole-length scale replicons  

<div class="attention" markdown="1">
- (Nuclear) genome
- Organelle genome
- Chromosome
- Virus/Phage genome/segments
- Plasmid
</div>

#### c) Sequence data to be described BioProject or BioSample in DBLINK  

When you need to use [DBLINK](/ddbj/flat-file-e.html#DBLINK) to link BioProject or BioSample, 
the following cases are included, but not limited to them.    

<div class="attention" markdown="1">
- Sequence data from metagenome analyses, environmental profilings, and so on 
- Sequence data of targeted genes to be linked each other
- When you are planning to submit or have submitted whole genome scale data obtained from the same samples. 
    - Required to submit prokaryotic 16S rRNA gene for phylogenic report  
    - Advanced paper submission of any other targeted gene(s)/cluster region(s) 
</div>


## Illustrated guides  {#How_to_submit}

- [Manual (PDF)](/assets/files/pdf/ddbj/websubHelp_full-e.pdf)
- [NSSS help page](/ddbj/web-submission-help-e.html)

## Before you start 

  - As a first step, please read the descriptions of "[Before Submission](/ddbj/submission-e.html)" and "[Required preparation before submission](/ddbj/sequence-e.html#process)".
  - TPA:experimental and/or TPA:inferential as a small scale [TPA data](/ddbj/tpa-e.html) submission is also acceptable via this system.
  - Trim the vector or adapter regions from the nucleotide sequences. You can check it by using [VecScreen](http://ddbj.nig.ac.jp/vecscreen/).

## How to resume the submission
  - Save the bookmark after the clicking at each page. Then you can resume the submission from the bookmark.

## Recommended internet browser
  - [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html) or [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/ja/firefox/all/)

## Updates, Questions   {#UpdatesQuestions}

  - This system accepts only new submissions. DO NOT send update request via this system.  
  - Regarding the update request after you have got accession number(s), see the [Data Update](/ddbj/update-e.html#ddbj) site.
  - If you encounter any problem during submission, please contact us with "Submission ID" through [contact form](/contact-ddbj-e.html).
