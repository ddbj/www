This page shows steps of genome sequencing, categories of sequence data and their correspondences, briefly.    
The schematic diagram below indicates phases of typical genome sequencing strategies.    
Also, please submit to 
[BioProject](/bioproject/index-e.html ) and 
[BioSample](/biosample/index-e.html ), in case of large scale genome sequencing project.    

**Important:** [Data submission of human subjects research](/policies-e.html#submission-of-human-data)

[DRA] Raw outputs: data generated by next-generation sequencers  
: In case of output data generated by next-generation sequencing platforms, submit to 
[DDBJ Sequence Read Archive (DRA)](/dra/index-e.html).

<!-- [DTA] Chromatograms, Sequences, Qualities: data generated by sequencers based on Sanger method 
: In case of single-pass reads of DNA sequence chromatograms (traces), 
base calls, quality estimates, submit to 
[Trace Archive (DTA)](/dta/index-e.html). -->

[WGS] Contigs: assemblies (overlapping reads)  
: In case of assemblies (i.e. overlapping reads) that are
appropriately assembled sequences excluded redundancy from raw
reads, submit to [Mass Submission System](/ddbj/mss-e.html) as
[WGS](/ddbj/wgs-e.html) data.

[HTG] draft sequences of large clones  
: In case of unfinished level, draft sequences of BAC, YAC or fosmid
clones, submit to [Mass Submission System](/ddbj/mss-e.html) as
[HTG](/ddbj/htg-e.html) data.

<!-- [CON] Scaffolds: supercontigs or clone tiling path  
: In cases of assembled sequences separated by gaps, so-called
supercontigs, and/or tiling path of large clones, submit to [Mass
Submission System](/ddbj/mss-e.html) as [CON](/ddbj/con-e.html) data. -->

[Finished level genomic sequences](/ddbj/finished_level_genome-e.html )  
: Submit to [Mass Submission System](/ddbj/mss-e.html) as general data or complete genomes.
