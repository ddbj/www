## Data Submission from Transcriptome Project

This page shows steps of transcriptome project, categories of sequence
data and their correspondences, briefly.  
The schematic diagram below indicates phases of typical transcriptome
strategies.  
Also, please submit to [BioProject](/bioproject/index-e.html) and
[BioSample](/biosample/index-e.html), in case of using next-generation
sequencing platforms.

**Important:** [Data submission of human subjects
research](/policies-e.html#submission-of-human-data)

<img src="/assets/images/ddbj/transcriptome.png" alt="" title="" class="">

[DRA] Raw outputs: data generated by next-generation sequencers  
: In case of output data generated by next-generation sequencing
platforms, submit to [DDBJ Sequence Read Archive
(DRA)](/dra/index-e.html).

[DTA] Chromatograms, Sequences, Qualities: data generated by
: sequencers based on Sanger method  
In case of single-pass reads of DNA sequence chromatograms (traces),
base calls, quality estimates, submit to [Trace Archive
(DTA)](/dta/index-e.html).

[TSA] Contigs: assemblies (overlapping reads) and Scaffolds  
: In case of assembled cDNA sequences, submit to [Mass Submission
System](/ddbj/mss-e.html) as [TSA](/ddbj/tsa-e.html) data.

[EST] Expressed Sequence Tags  
: In case of single-pass cDNA sequences, submit to [Mass Submission
System](/ddbj/mss-e.html) as [EST](/ddbj/est-e.html) data.

[HTC] draft sequences of large clones  
: In case of unfinished level, draft sequence data derived from cDNA
libraries created using full length insert cDNA cloning methods,
submit to [Mass Submission System](/ddbj/mss-e.html) as
[HTC](/ddbj/htc-e.html) data.

Finished sequences of cDNA clones  
: Submit to [Mass Submission System](/ddbj/mss-e.html) as general data
or full length insert cDNAs.
