This page shows steps of transcriptome project, categories of sequence
data and their correspondences, briefly.    
The schematic diagram below indicates phases of typical transcriptome
strategies.    
Also, please submit to 
[BioProject](/bioproject/index-e.html ) and
[BioSample](/biosample/index-e.html ), in case of using next-generation sequencing platforms.    

**Important:** [Data submission of human subjects research](/policies-e.html#submission-of-human-data)

[DRA] Raw outputs: data generated by next-generation sequencers  
: In case of output data generated by next-generation sequencing platforms, submit to 
[DDBJ Sequence Read Archive (DRA)](/dra/index-e.html ).

<!-- 
[DTA] Chromatograms, Sequences, Qualities: data generated by sequencers based on Sanger method 
: In case of single-pass reads of DNA sequence chromatograms (traces), base calls, quality estimates, submit to 
[Trace Archive (DTA)](/dta/index-e.html ).
 -->

[TSA] Contigs: assemblies (overlapping reads) and Scaffolds  
: In case of assembled cDNA sequences, submit to 
[Mass Submission System](/ddbj/mss-e.html ) as 
[TSA](/ddbj/tsa-e.html ) data.

[EST] Expressed Sequence Tags  
: In case of single-pass cDNA sequences, submit to 
[Mass Submission System](/ddbj/mss-e.html ) as 
[EST](/ddbj/est-e.html ) data.

[HTC] draft sequences of large clones  
: In case of unfinished level, draft sequence data derived from cDNA 
libraries created using full length insert cDNA cloning methods, submit to 
[Mass Submission System](/ddbj/mss-e.html ) as
[HTC](/ddbj/htc-e.html ) data.

Finished sequences of cDNA clones  
: Submit to [Mass Submission System](/ddbj/mss-e.html ) as general data or full length insert cDNAs.
