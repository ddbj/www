# DDBJ flat file format

DDBJ/EMBL-Bank/GenBank, the International Nucleotide Sequence Database
Collaboration ([INSDC](/about/insdc-e.html)) collects the nucleotide sequences
experimentally determined, and constructs the database in accordance
with the rule agreed with the three databanks.

The database also includes the data from [Japan Patent
Office](//www.jpo.go.jp/index.htm) (JPO), [European Patent
Office](//www.epo.org/) (EPO), [United States Patent and Trademark
Office](https://www.uspto.gov/) (USPTO), and [Korean Intellectual
Property Office](//www.kipo.go.kr/) (KIPO).

The database is a collection of "entry" which is the unit of the data.
The entry submitted to DDBJ is processed and publicized according to the
DDBJ format for distribution (flat file). The flat file includes the
sequence and the information of submitters, references, source
organisms, and "feature" information, etc. The "feature" is defined by
[The DDBJ/ENA/GenBank Feature Table Definition](/ddbj/feature-table-e.html)
to describe the biological nature such as gene function and other
property of the nucleotide sequence.

The corresponding entries of the CON entry have been submitted to other divisions.  |


<div id="ModificationDateB" markdown="1">
<h4><a href="#ModificationDateA">The date of last release</a></h4>
</div>

The current publicized date is described. If the entry is updated and reopened to public site, this date will be changed.


<div id="DefinitionB" markdown="1">
<h3><a href="#DefinitionA">DEFINITION</a></h3>
</div>

The definition briefly describes the information of gene(s). "DEFINITION" is constructed by each of the three data banks in accordance with standard rules in principle.However, in the case of EST or GSS submission using Mass Submission System, DDBJ will sometimes ask submitters to construct "DEFINITION".

[Sample]

<div id="AccessionB" markdown="1">
<h3><a href="#AccessionA">ACCESSION</a></h3>
</div>

This line shows accession number of the entry data.

Conventional sequence data  
: A unique accession number is issued to the data submitter by each of the three data banks. The accession number is composed of 1 alphabet character and 5 digits (ex. A12345) or 2 alphabet characters and 6 digits (ex. AB123456). The former style was used in 1980s, but later the latter style was introduced because of data explosion.
<br>The alphabet part is called "prefix". Please refer [the prefix list](/documents/prefix-e.html).

: If multiple entries are united to an entry, or if an entry is extensively modified after the submission, the responsible data banks may assign a new accession number to it. In these cases, the new accession number is called the primary accession number, and the old accession number(s) is/are called the secondary accession number(s). In the flat file, the primary accession number is indicated first, then the secondary accession number(s) follows. You can find the same updated entry with both the primary and the secondary accession numbers.

: 
<pre class="code flat-file"><code>  ACCESSION   AB999999 AB888888 AB777777
</code></pre>


  |  ```AB999999```  |  primary accession number  |
  |  ```AB888888 AB777777```  |  secondary accession number  |

Bulk sequence data; WGS, TSA, TLS  
: The accession number assigned to each entry of [WGS](/ddbj/wgs-e.html), [TSA](/ddbj/tsa-e.html) and TLS data consists of 4 alphabet characters and 8 (sometimes 9 or 10, if necessary) digits.<br>The alphabet part is called [prefix](/documents/prefix-e.html).<br>See also [For Large Scale Data (four prefix)](/documents/prefix-e.html#large).<br>Example:ZZZZ01000001

  | ZZZZ (4 letters) | Prefix to distinguish each project, project_id                 |
  | 01 (2 digits)        | Version number of the data set, set_version                |
  | 000001 (6 digits)	    | ID of each individual sequence (It might be 7 or 8 digits depended on the number of entries.) |

  The set_version goes up for every update of the dataset. Example:ZZZZ02000001

: 
<pre class="code flat-file"><code>  ACCESSION   ZZZZ01000001 ZZZZ01000000
</code></pre>

  | ```ZZZZ01000001``` | primary accession number   |
  | ```ZZZZ01000000``` | set ID   |

For MGA data
: This (ACEESSION) line shows a number assigned by INSDC to a resource.
: The number is composed of 5 alphabet characters and 7 digits (ex. ABCDE0000001).An accession number assigned to an entry of a resource units is displayed in the MGA lines.
: Example:ABCDE0000001

  |AB (first two characters)	identi  | identifier to each project. |
  | CDE (third to fifth characters)	   | identifier to each of resources on each project.  |
  | 0000001 (7 digit numeric numbers)	 | number for each sequence entry in a resource.    |

  \*1 The information about each project id is avilable at the [project_index ](https://ddbj.nig.ac.jp/public/ddbj_database/mga/project_index-e.html) page.<br>\*2 "resource" here means a unit of identical origin, such as tissue, cells, from which sequence are obtained.

: 
<pre class="code flat-file"><code>  ACCESSION   ZZZZZ0000000
</code></pre>

  | ```ZZZZZ0000000``` | number to a resource unit   |


<div id="VersionB" markdown="1">
<h3><a href="#VersionA">VERSION</a></h3>
</div>

This line consists of an accession number and a version number, like "AB123456.1", in which the digit(s) after the period is a version number.

The data open to public for the first time is version number as "1". The reason for adding VERSION is that since a released sequence sometimes revised by the submitter, the accession number alone cannot specify the sequence in question causing the user a trouble. The number is increased by one every time when a revised sequence is made public. And accession number will NOT be changed generally.

<pre class="code flat-file"><code>  VERSION      AB000000.1
</code></pre>

| ```AB000000``` | accession number   |
| ```1``` | version number   |

For MGA data
: This line consists of a number assigned to a resources unit in which the digit(s) after the period is a version number.  
Since the sequence of an MGA entry is not allowed to update, the version number has to be "1".

: 
<pre class="code flat-file"><code>  VERSION    ZZZZZ0000000.1
</code></pre>

  | ```ZZZZZ000000```  | number to a resource unit |
  | ```1```   | version number   |  


<div id="DblinkB" markdown="1">
<h3><a href="#DblinkA">DBLINK</a></h3>
</div>

The DBLINK line is used to link other databases for BioProject, BioSample accession numbers, Sequence Read Archive Run accession numbers and so on.

DDBJ has replaced the PROJECT line by DBLINK line format since 2009 to expand for other data resources than projects.

<pre class="code flat-file"><code>  COMMENT     The CAGE (cap analysis gene expression) is based on preparation
              and sequencing of concatamers of DNA tags deriving from the
              initial 20/21 nucleotides from 5' end mRNAs.
              Full-length cDNAs were at first selected with the Cap-Trapper
              method. Then, a specific linker (Linker1, some linker contain 5 bp
              sequences that have 15 variations for each rna sample) containing
              the ClassIIs restriction enzyme site MmeI was then ligated to the
              single-strand cDNA and then the second strand of cDNA synthesized.
              The resulting double-stranded cDNA was cleaved by the restriction
              enzyme MmeI and a second linker (Linker2) was ligated to the 2 bp
              overhang at the MmeI cleaved site, to produce a 5' 20/21 tag
              having two linkers at both sides. The ligation products were
              separated from unmodified DNA with magnetic beads. The 5' end cDNA
              tags were released from the beads, and the DNA fragments were
              amplified in a PCR step by using the two linker-specific primers
              (Primer1 (uni-PCR), Primer2 (MmeI-PCR)). The desired 32-37 bp tags
              were purified and ligated to form concatamers, and then the
              concatamer were fractionated and ligated to the plasmid ZErO-2.
              The ligations were finally electroporated into DH10b cells
              (Invitrogen) and obtained plasmids were sequenced with forward
              primers.
              CAGE libraries were sequenced with forward primers essentially as
              described with minor modifications to use zeocin for selection of
              recombinants. We used in-house developed algorithms for the
              extraction of tags and for masking the vectors. CAGE tags were
              extracted with the following parameters: vector masking, minimum
              12 bp recognition allowed; linker (13 bp) masking: maximum
              mismatch, 2 bp allowed; XmaJI site maximum mismatch, 2 bp allowed;
              tag length, 17-24 bp.

<h3><a href="#FeaturesA">FEATURES</a></h3>
</div>

Biological features of a submitted sequence data are described with "Feature" key (the biological nature of the annotated feature), "Location" (the region of the sequence which corresponds to Feature), and "Qualifier" (supplementary information about Feature). In principle, EST or GSS entries are not described with any features except the "source" key.

FEATURES are indicated on the basis of the information provided by submitter and modified by databanks to describe the appropriate annotation. The rules of feature description agreed with three databanks are explained at [The DDBJ/ENA/GenBank Feature Table Definition](/ddbj/feature-table-e.html) in detail.

Feature keys are briefly classified into 3 groups;

- group 1: biological source of the sequence (source)<br>The feature, "source" (group 1) is mandatory for all entries in the international nucleotide database.<br>The qualifiers "/organism" and "/mol_type" are mandatory for source feature.
- group 2: biological function features of the region<br>Feature keys in group 2 fall into families which are in some sense similar in function and which are annotated in a similar manner.A functional family may have a "generic" or miscellaneous key, which can be recognized by the 'misc_' prefix, that can used for instances not covered by the other defined keys of that group.<br>e.g. CDS, rRNA, etc.
- group 3: difference and/or change of the sequence data<br>e.g. variation, conflict, etc.

One of the most frequently used feature key is "CDS" to describe coding sequence for protein. See also [CDS feature](/ddbj/cds-e.html) page.
