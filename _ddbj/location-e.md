| complement(join(12..78,134..202)) | Regions 12 to 78 and 134 to 202 sequence on complementary strand should be joined to form one contiguous sequence.                                                                                                                                           |
| 467                               | Points to a single base 467 in the presented sequence.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

With the combination of list above, it is able to describe various ways
of indicating the sequence location.
