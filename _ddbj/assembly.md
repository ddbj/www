The original site; [INSDC standards for genome assembly submission](http://www.insdc.org/insdc-standards-genome-assembly-submission) 2013.08.14 version

Genome assemblies comprise a number of possible layers of information, including reads, contigs, scaffolds and chromosomes (see figure I). This document lays out the requirements for submission of genome assembly information into INSDC databases.

## Figure I. Three typical assembly processes  {#Figure_I._Three_typical_assembly_processes}

Figure I. The figure shows three typical assembly processes and the layers of information that they yield.  
A) Clone-based assembly with scaffolding and finishing steps.  
B) Shotgun assembly direct to chromosomes.  
C) Partial assembly to contigs only.

Consistent with the variety of assembly processes, submitters to INSDC　approach with data for the layers in different combinations of　layers.　Tables I and II shows requirements for new genome assembly　submissions　and updates to existing assembly submissions.

## Table II. Update to existing genome assembly  {#Table_II._Update_to_existing_genome_assembly}

Third party genome assembly submissions and updates, in which the　submitting group does not hold complete ownership of data, are subject　to existing third party annotation rules, including the requirement for　presentation of the new/updated genome assembly in a peer reviewed　publication prior to public release from INSDC.
