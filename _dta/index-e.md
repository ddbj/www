## DDBJ Trace Archive

[DDBJ Trace Archive (DTA)](/index-e.html) is a permanent repository of
DNA sequence chromatograms (traces), base calls, and quality estimates
for single-pass reads from various large-scale sequencing projects. DTA
is a member of the [International Nucleotide Sequence Database
Collaboration (INSDC)](/insdc-e.html) and collects the data in a
collaboration with [NCBI Trace
Archive](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/trace.cgi) and [EBI Trace
Archive](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/). Released data can be searched and
retrieved at the [NCBI Trace
Archive](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/trace.cgi).
