## Trace Archive overview  {#overview}

[DDBJ Trace Archive (DTA)](/index-e.html)is a permanent repository of
DNA sequence chromatograms (traces), base calls, and quality estimates
for single-pass reads from various large-scale sequencing projects. DTA
is a member of the [International Nucleotide Sequence Database
Collaboration (INSDC)](/about/insdc-e.html)and collects the data in a
collaboration with
[NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/trace.cgi)and
[EBI](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/). [NCBI Trace
Archive](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/trace.cgi)issues and
manages IDs.

Released data can be searched and retrieved at the [NCBI Trace
Archive](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/trace.cgi).

Required<span class="red">*</span>  
May be required, depending upon the trace type and strategy
employed<span class="conditionally_required">*</span>

### Metadata Field List  {#Metadata-Field-List}

[ACCESSION](#ACCESSION)<a name="ACCESSION"></a>   
: DDBJ/EMBL/Genbank accession number  

  &emsp; Type: varchar(30)  
  &emsp; Example: AC22227  

  The [ACCESSION](#ACCESSION) is assigned upon deposition to a public repository (DDBJ/EMBL/Genbank). This field will not be applicable to all trace types (primarily WGS). However, if this field contains a validaccession identifier correlation between the primary sequence data (in Trace) and the secondary sequence data (in the public repository) is facilitated.

  Trace files which do not include the basecalls must provide this information in a separate file. The file designations are recorde din the [BASE_FILE](#BASE_FILE) field of the metadata file. If basecalls are provided in separate files the information in these files will overwrite any information in the trace (usually *.scf) file. If the base calls that would be provided in the [BASE_FILE](#BASE_FILE) are the same as the information in the trace file, DO NOT PROVIDE THE FILE. If the center provides the[BASE_FILE](#BASE_FILE) and[QUAL_FILE](#QUAL_FILE), then the peak index information should also be provided in a file called[PEAK_FILE](#PEAK_FILE).

  [WELL_ID](#WELL_ID) in
  combination with the field
  [PLATE_ID](#PLATE_ID), is used to
  define the storage location of the sequencing reaction (see note
  with the
  field[PLATE_ID](#PLATE_ID)).
  Typically,sequencing reactions are performed in standard microtiter
  dishes having either 96 or 384 wells (see standard configurations
  below).

## Submit trace data  {#trace-data-submission}


<div class="attention" markdown="1">
Data submission of human subjects research<br>
<span class="red">For all data from human subjects researches submitted to DDBJ, it is
submitter's responsibility to ensure that the privacy of participant
(human subject) is protected in accordance with all applicable laws,
regulations and policies of submitter's institute.  
In principle, make sure to remove any direct personal identifiers of
human subjects from your submissions.  
Before submitting data from human subjects researches, read the "[Data
submission of human subjects research](/policies-e.html#submission-of-human-data)".</span>
</div>

### Create submission files  {#create-submission-files}

The metadata file (TRACEINFO file) describes the submitted data as well
as points to the location of the chromatograms. All submissions when
extracted should have a top directory. All metadata files should be
placed under that directory. In case when the submission should contain
trace files at least one more directory should be introduced to the top
directory and all trace files should be placed under that directory. The
trace files (either in [SCF](#TRACE_FORMAT)or in
[ABI](#TRACE_FORMAT)format) should not appear in the top level
directory, but rather should be in a subdirectory. It is suggested to
use the name of the traces or the name of the project for
subdirectories. There may be subdirectories within and this is
encouraged to group traces. Below are examples of the submission
directory hierarchy.

#### Submission directory hierarchy example  {#Submission_directory_hierarchy_example}

```
TOP_DIRECTORY/
TOP_DIRECTORY/TRACEINFO
TOP_DIRECTORY/traces
TOP_DIRECTORY/traces/FLJ/
TOP_DIRECTORY/traces/FLJ/FLJA1U0001.scf
TOP_DIRECTORY/traces/FLJ/FLJA1U0002.scf
TOP_DIRECTORY/traces/FLJ/FLJA1U0003.scf
```

The [metadata](#metadata)file can be either in XML or in tab-delimited
format. The metadata requirements are in the [Validation Table
(spreadsheet format)](/assets/files/submission/field_matrix_current.xls)for
specific combinations of STRATEGY and TRACE_TYPE_CODE. Both types of
metadata files can contain common fields section at the beginning of it.
This section defines common for the submission values if any.

Below are examples of TRACEINFO metadata files.

#### TRACEINFO xml example  {#TRACEINFO_xml_example}

### Upload submission files  {#upload-submission-files}

DTA creates a directory for data submission. Please contact to [the DTA
team](/contact-ddbj-e.html). Transfer files by SCP according to the
[manual](/dra/submission.html#upload-sequence-data).

#### Submission directory example  {#Submission_directory_example}

```
submission/submitter_id/dta/dta_submitter_id-0001
```

<span class="red">Directory for the DTA submission is
separated from those for the [DDBJ Sequence Read
Archive](/dra/index-e.html). </span>



### Completion of submission  {#completion-submission}

After submission files become complete, DTA can keep the data private
until the submitters instruct us to release the data. After instruction
of data release, DTA uploads the files to the NCBI Trace Archive. As
soon as the data are loaded to the NCBI Trace Archive, TI numbers are
assigned and the data become public.

<span class="red">Please note that TI number assignment and
data release are concurrent events. </span>


### Update  {#update}

To update the records, please contact to [the DTA
team](/contact-ddbj-e.html).
