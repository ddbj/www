## /inference qualifier vocabulary recommendation document

The original site; [/inference qualifier vocabulary recommendation document](http://www.insdc.org/documents/inference-qualifiers)
2013.08.15 version

The /inference qualifier provides a structured description of non-experimental evidence that supports feature identification or assignment. It allows data provides to point by name to data resources and tools that were implicated in the identification of the parent feature. These recommendations for choice of names for data resources and tools to be used in /inference annotations are provided in order to render features carrying the /inference qualifier more searchable and machine-readable.

  - Leading and trailing spaces should not be included in resource names
  - The following table presents recommended acronyms for commonly cited
    resources
