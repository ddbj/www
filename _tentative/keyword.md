| NON\_CONTIGUOUS\_FINISHED <span class="new">NEW\!</span> | This standard describes high-quality assemblies that have been subject to automated and manual improvement, and where closure approaches have been successful for almost all gaps, misassemblies, and low-quality regions. Attempts have been made to resolve all gap and sequence uncertainties, and only those recalcitrant to resolution remain (with notations in the genome submission as to the nature of the uncertainty). |
