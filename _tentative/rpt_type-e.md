This page contains the current definition, format and controlled
vocabularly for repeat type qualifier.

```
Qualifier: /rpt_type=
Definition: organization of repeated sequence 
Value format: tandem, inverted, flanking, terminal, direct, dispersed, and other
Example: /rpt_type=INVERTED 
Comment: the values are case-insensitive, i.e. both "INVERTED" and "inverted" are valid;

## Definitions of the values: <a name="Definitions_of_the_values_"></a>

tandem:  
: a repeat that consists of two or more adjacent copies of a region
whose length is greater than one in the same orientation;

inverted:  
: a repeat pair occurring in reverse orientation to one another on the
same molecule;

flanking:  
: a repeat lying outside the sequence for which it has functional
significance (eg. transposon insertion target sites);

terminal:  
: a repeat at the ends of and within the sequence for which it has
functional significance other than long terminal repeat;

direct:  
: a repeat where the same sequence is repeated in the same direction;

dispersed:  
: a repeat that is located at dispersed sites in the genome;

*nested:*  
: a repeat that is disrupted by the insertion of another element;

*long_terminal_repeat:*  
: a sequence directly repeated at both ends of a defined sequence, of
the sort typically found in retroviruses (replaces LTR Feature Key);

*non_ltr_retrotransposon_polymeric_tract:*  
: a polymeric tract, such as poly(dA), within a non LTR
retrotransposon;

*x_element_combinatorial_repeat:*  
: a repeat region located between the X element and the telomere or
adjacent Y' element;

*y_prime_element:*  
: a repeat region located adjacent to telomeric repeats or X element
combinatorial repeats, either as a single copy or tandem repeat of
two to four copies;

*telomeric_repeat:*  
: a repeat region found within the telomere;

*centromeric_repeat:*  
: a repeat region found within the modular centromere;

other:  
: a repeat exhibiting important attributes that cannot be described by
other values.
