## DDBJ group cloud service for sharing pre-publication data

As the sequencing technologies advance and the amount of genomic data
generated grows, it becomes critical to store, analyze and share
large-scale data with research collaborators efficiently. To facilitate
the sharing and analysis of pre-publication data among research groups,
the [DDBJ Center](/index-e.html) has operated a cloud-type service DDBJ
Group Cloud (DGC) on the [NIG
SuperComputer](https://sc.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/en) since February 2017.

In the DGC databases, users can upload and share their pre-publication
data with their research collaborators in the data models which are
identical to those of the public databases. Upon publication, users can
submit their data by simply transferring the data from the DGC database
to the corresponding public one of the DDBJ Center.

The DGC hosts the [AMED Genome Group Sharing Database
(AGD)](/agd/index-e.html) as the first use case. In the AGD, researchers
funded by the [Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development
(AMED)](//www.amed.go.jp/en) upload and share their pre-publication raw
personal genome sequencing data in the JGA’s data model. Because the DGC
is not a fully public service, the operating costs are shared with the
DGC users.
