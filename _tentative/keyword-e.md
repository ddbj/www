# INSDC agreed methodological keywords

The original site; [INSDC agreed methodological
keywords](http://www.insdc.org/documents/methodological-keywords)
2013.10.31 version

Methodological keywords are added at the discretion of the INSDC from a
controlled vocabulary of terms that explicitly describe the type of
sequence contained within the entry.

| STANDARD\_DRAFT                                          | Standard draft genome sequence data should refer to any number of reads, or runs on any number of different sequencing platforms, and assembled into sequenced contigs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| HIGH\_QUALITY\_DRAFT                                     | This should refer to a product with overall coverage representing greater than 90% of the genome or target region. Efforts should be made to include only sequence of the target organism and exclude contaminating sequences (e.g. from tissue cell lines).                                                                                                                                                                      |
| IMPROVED\_HIGH\_QUALITY\_DRAFT                           | This standard refers to a high-quality-draft assembled sequence where additional work has been performed beyond the initial shotgun sequencing and standard assembly using either manual or automated methods. In addition, this standard should contain no discernable misassemblies, and if feasible, should have attempted to reduce the number of contigs (thus reducing the number of gaps) and supercontigs (or scaffolds). |
| NON\_CONTIGUOUS\_FINISHED <span class="new">NEW\!</span> | This standard describes high-quality assemblies that have been subject to automated and manual improvement, and where closure approaches have been successful for almost all gaps, misassemblies, and low-quality regions. Attempts have been made to resolve all gap and sequence uncertainties, and only those recalcitrant to resolution remain (with notations in the genome submission as to the nature of the uncertainty). |
