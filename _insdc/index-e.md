## The International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC)

{: .float-left }
[INSDC](http://www.insdc.org/ ) is a global collaboration of independent governmental or non-profit organisations 
that manage nucleotide sequence databases capturing and preserving nucleotide sequence information 
and annotations to create a comprehensive collection that preserves the scientific record 
and enables broad sharing of such data.    
[INSDC Members](#member) exchange data and make exchanged data freely accessible 
without restrictive licensing as part of the scientific record, including all corrections and updates.

## Governance

The INSDC is governed by two committees as detailed below:    


### Executive Committee {#ec} 

The Executive Committee establishes the strategic directions of INSDC, 
directs administrative activities such as organising meetings 
and overseeing the INSDC website content, resolves disputes, and sets membership expectations.    


### Implementation Committee  {#ic} 

The INSDC Implementation Committee accepts INSDC-wide policies, protocols, and procedures; 
prepares for and responds to technology changes; 
approves modifications for infrastructure requirements, features, and schemas used 
to build INSDC-participating repositories and their services; 
 trains, assesses, and approves new INSDC Members; 
and maintains website content and internal documentation.    

See [INSDC meeting report](/activities/index-e.html?tag=insdc_meeting )



### Members and Participating Databases {#member}

The INSDC is a collaboration between the following member organisations and their databases:

## Mission and Vision

The mission of INSDC is to support advancements in biomedical and life sciences, public health, 
research, innovation, discovery, education, capacity building, and bioeconomies by providing services 
to accept, preserve, and openly disseminate sequence data and metadata that are generated worldwide.    

INSDC is the premiere open access nucleotide sequence data sharing collaboration in the world, 
fostering access of nucleotide sequence data from all continents and regions, 
and providing broad recognition to those who generate and share sequence data.    

The INSDC mission and vision builds upon [the previous INSDC policies](https://www.insdc.org/policy/ ).
