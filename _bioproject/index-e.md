The BioProject database represents a higher order organization of research projects and the corresponding data which is deposited into several archival databases maintained by members of [INSDC](http://www.insdc.org/). Data submitted to [INSDC](http://www.insdc.org/)-associated databases cross-reference the BioProject identifier to support navigation between the project and the project’s datasets. The BioProject record has information about a project’s scope, material, objectives, funding source and general relevance categories. The [BioProject](index-e.html) resource is a redesigned, expanded, replacement of the NCBI Genome Project resource.

The [DDBJ BioProject](index-e.html) issues accession numbers with the prefix 'PRJD' to the submitted projects. Public project data are exchanged with the [EBI](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/)and[NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject).
