description: "The BioProject database represents a higher order organization of research projects and the corresponding data which is deposited into several archival databases maintained by members of INSDC. Data submitted to INSDC-associated databases cross-reference the BioProject identifier to support navigation between the project and the project’s datasets. The BioProject record has information about a project’s scope,material, objectives, funding source and general relevance categories. The BioProject resource is a redesigned, expanded, replacement of the NCBI Genome Project resource.The DDBJ BioProject issues accession numbers with the prefix 'PRJD' to the submitted projects. Public project data are exchanged with the EBI and NCBI."
