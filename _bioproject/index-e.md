BioProject is a database of research projects and organizes data derived from a project. By cross-referencing a BioProject accession number, data are grouped by a project.  
The DDBJ BioProject issues accession numbers with the prefix 'PRJDB' to submitted projects. Public project data are exchanged with [EBI](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/) and [NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject).
