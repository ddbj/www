Submission of research data from human subjects
: <span class="red">For submitting data from human subjects (human data) to the
databases of DDBJ center, it is submitter's responsibility to ensure
that the dignity and right of human subject are protected in
accordance with all applicable laws, ordinances, guidelines and
policies of submitter's institution. In principle, make sure to
remove any direct personal identifiers of human subjects from your
data to be submitted. Before submitting human data, read the
"[Submission of research data from human
subjects](/policies-e.html#submission-of-human-data)".</span>

## Cases requiring project registration  {#project-registration}

Please check whether a project registration is necessary or not for your data submission in the [submission navigation site](/submission-navigation-e.html).
Registration for a BioProject accession is not required for small datasets for which the results are found in one (or a small number) of accession numbers such as a single plasmid, viral or organelle genome sequencing study.

## Submit a new BioProject submission  {#new-bioproject-submission}

Obtain a submission [account](/account-e.html).

Submit a new project by clicking the \[New submission\].

<div class="attention">
If there is no reply from submitters after three months of initial contact, submissions will be cancelled.
</div>

To submit a BioProject, enter content from left to right tabs. Submitter information is copied with account information.

For BioProject information fileds, please see [BioProject information fields](/bioproject/project-info-e.html).

{% include image.html url="books/hbp-02.jpg" caption="Enter project content" class="w450" %}

<div class="attention" markdown="1">
To submit genome sequences having functional annotations to [DDBJ](/ddbj/genome-e.html), [locus tag prefix(s)](/ddbj/locus_tag-e.html) should be registered in [BioSample](/biosample/submission-e.html).
Since 9th November 2022, the locus tag prefix
</div>

Check the content in "OVERVIEW" and submit a project by clicking the \[Submit\].

{% include image.html url="books/hbp-04.jpg" caption="Submit BioProject" class="w450" %}

## Accession number  {#accession-number}

A BioProject accession number with prefix PRJDB is automatically assigned to the submitted project.
When the data release is specified as "Release immediately following curation", the project will be automatically released at night.

<div class="attention">
- Do NOT cite numbers with prefix PSUB in publication.<br>
- Do not double submit the projects which have been registered to EBI and NCBI.
</div>

## Human data {#human-data}

To submit data corresponding to personal identification code to DRA/GEA/DDBJ, [your data submission application needs to be approved by DBCLS before the submission](/policies-e.html#unrestricted-access). If your application was approved, write the application ID (for example, J-DS000001-001) in "Private comments to DDBJ staff" of BioProject.

{% include image.html url="books/bp-nbdc-approval.jpg" caption="Data submission application ID" class="w450" %}

## Submit an umbrella project  {#submit-umbrella-project}

Umbrella project can be submitted as primary project in [D-way](https://ddbj.nig.ac.jp/D-way/). <span class="red">Be sure to tell the DDBJ BioProject staff that submitting project is umbrella by writing so in the [Private comments to DDBJ staff](#Private_comments). </span>
Umbrell project cannot be kept private.

When submitting an umbrella project to group [pseudohaplotype](/ddbj/pseudohaplotype-e.html#bioproject) datasets, enter accession numbers of primary BioProjects to be linked and their names for pseudohaplotypes (e.g. PRJDB1 Principal, PRJDB2 Alternate and PRJDB3 DRA).

{% include image.html url="books/hbp-05.jpg" caption="Tell DDBJ staff that submitting project is umbrella" class="w450" %}

## Link primary project to umbrella  {#link-primary-project-umbrella}

When submitting project, in the [Umbrella BioProject](/bioproject/project-info-e.html#Area_linked-project), enter abstract and accession number of an umbrella to be linked. The DDBJ BioProject staff link the submitted primary project to the umbrella based on this information.

{% include image.html url="books/hbp-06.jpg" caption="Link to umbrella" class="w450" %}

## Release of projects  {#project-release}

Registered projects can be released in the following two ways. Hold date cannot be set for BioProject.
* Release immediately after registration.
* Release when records citing the BioProject accession are made public.

The projects can be kept private.
If DDBJ/DRA/GEA/MetaboBank records citing the BioProject accession are made public,
[cited projects are automatically released](/bioproject/project-e.html#release).
The BioProject release does not trigger release of private DDBJ/DRA/GEA/MetaboBank data citing the BioProject accession.

Public projects are exchanged among [NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject) and [EBI](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/) BioProject databases.

## Update  {#update}

Registered projects can be updated. Please inform us updated contents through the [contact form](/contact-ddbj-e.html) so that we will update the projects.

## Add publication information {#publication}

Request addition of [publication information](/bioproject/project-info-e.html#Publication) (pubmed ID, doi when pubmed ID is not available) to BioProject through the [Contact form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeNrBMkr9lV6IaWCJCXeGBddDF3tJXcv6SQCQ5lYWETmiuRAg/viewform) by selecting "BioProject/BioSample/Sequence Read Archive (DRA)" in the Contacts menu.

## Link experimental data and project  {#link-experimental-data-project}

For the DRA/GEA/MetaboBank submissions, select the BioProject accession that you registered in advance in the Study.
For genome and TSA submissions to the DDBJ, enter the BioProject accession in the DBLINK.

## Inquiry {#inquiry}

If a project has a novel organism name or human data, we may ask you questions after an accession number is automatically assigned.
