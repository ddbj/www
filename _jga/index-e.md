The Japanese Genotype-phenotype Archive (JGA) is a service for archiving and sharing of individual-level genetic and phenotypic data. Data submission to JGA and JGA data use are reviewed by the [Database Center for Life Science (DBCLS)](https://humandbs.dbcls.jp/en/).

## Data use {#access}

[Apply for data use](https://humandbs.dbcls.jp/en/data-use) to DBCLS. Once the application is approved, JGA will grant the user access to the data. [How to use data](/jga/download-e.html)

## Data submission {#submission}

[Apply for data submission](https://humandbs.dbcls.jp/en/data-submission) to DBCLS. Once the application is approved, a JGA submission directory for uploading metadata and data files will be created. [Submission to JGA](/jga/submission-e.html)

## Data release {#release}

After a [research site](https://humandbs.dbcls.jp/en/data-use/all-researches) corresponding to JGA data is published at the NBDC Human Database, the JGA data will also be made publicly available. The research summaries, JGA Study/Dataset, and the usage restrictions, JGA Policy, will be accessible without restrictions at [DDBJ Search](https://ddbj.nig.ac.jp/search).
