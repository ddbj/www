## Group {#group}

The applications to DBCLS, JGA submissions and downloads are managed
through groups consisting from D-way account holders as members. Through
groups, a principal investigator (PI) and applicant are able to
co-manage data without sharing their accounts. The PI is able to keep
access rights properly by removing members when they leave the PI's
laboratory. Regarding groups, please see "[Group](/group-e.html)" for
details.

## Data submitter group {#subgrp}

The applications to DBCLS and JGA data submissions are managed by data
submitter groups. In the [application
system](https://humandbs.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/nbdc/application/), create a
group before submitting a data submission application. Include the PI
who is responsible for the submission and applicant who actually submits
data as members. In the new JGA system, submitters need to be members
instead of listed in the JGA Submission.

In the application system, select "Create Group" in the left menu. In the
"Create Group" window, enter the name and description of the group, and
choose the "Data Submitter Group" and click Save button.

A subgrp ID (for example, subgrp5352) is assigned to the data submitter
group.

The account holder (account_b) who creates the group become the group
owner. In the Member tab, the owner can invite a member. Click "Invite"
in the "Edit Group" window.

Enter an account ID (account_c) or an e-mail address of an account to
be invited. Send an invitation e-mail by clicking "Invite".


{% include image.html url="books/create-group-4_e.jpg" caption="Invite a member" class="w450" %}

If the invited account holder click a link in the invitation e-mail,
he/she will be added as a member.


{% include image.html url="books/create-group-5_e.jpg" caption="Addition of a member" class="w450" %}

The account_c of the PI is added.

In this data submission application and subsequent JGA submission,
account_c and account_b are submitters. After finishing the
submission, the account_b can transfer PI and Owner to account_c.
