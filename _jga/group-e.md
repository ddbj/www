## Group {#group}

The applications to NBDC, JGA submissions and downloads are managed
through groups consisting from D-way account holders as members. Through
groups, a principal investigator (PI) and applicant are able to
co-manage data without sharing their accounts. The PI is able to keep
access rights properly by removing members when they leave the PI's
laboratory. Regarding groups, please see "[Group](/group-e.html)" for
details.

## Data submitter group {#subgrp}

The applications to NBDC and JGA data submissions are managed by data
submitter groups. In the [NBDC application
system](https://humandbs.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/nbdc/application/), create a
group before submitting a data submission application. Include the PI
who is responsible for the submission and applicant who actually submits
data as members. In the new JGA system, submitters need to be members
instead of listed in the JGA Submission.

In the NBDC system, select "Create Group" in the left menu. In the
"Create Group" window, enter the name and description of the group, and
choose the "Data Submitter Group" and click Save button.

In this data submission application and subsequent JGA submission,
account\_c and account\_b are submitters. After finishing the
submission, the account\_b can transfer PI and Owner to account\_c.
