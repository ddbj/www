## Data upload {#upload} 

This page explains how to upload data files for DRA/GEA/DDBJ/MetaboBank to the DDBJ file server.

### Host name and port number  {#hostandport}

- Hostname: ftp-private.ddbj.nig.ac.jp
- Port number: 22

### Destination directories to upload  {#uploaddestination}

The destination directories are different with the databases. Do NOT create sub-directories under the destination directories of DRA and GEA.  

- DRA: ~/\<DRA submission ID\> (for example, test07-0018)
- GEA: ~/gea/\<GEA submission ID\> (for example, ESUB000350)
- MSS: ~/mass [Read the detailed description](/ddbj/mss-e.html#sftpmss)
- MetaboBank: ~/metabobank

Upload [JGA](/jga/submission-step-e.html) data files to the different server.

## Terminal {#terminal}

### Linux/Mac OS X {#terminal-linux}

Upload files by using scp.

Command format:  
scp -i \<Your private key> \<Your Files> \<D-way Login ID>@ftp-private.ddbj.nig.ac.jp:~/\<Destination directory>

- \<Your private key\>: the private key for authentication which is pair of a public key registered to your D-way account. For example, ~/.ssh/id_rsa
- \<Your Files\>: Files to be uploaded.  
For example, strainA_1.fastq, raw1.txt raw2.txt (raw1.txt and raw2.txt) and *.bam (files with bam extension specified by a wild card).
- \<D-way Login ID\>: D-way Login ID. For example, test07.
- \<Destination directory\>: the destination directory.   
For example, DRA: \<DRA submission ID\>, GEA: \<GEA submission ID\>, DDBJ: /mass and MetaboBank: /metabobank.

Example commands (DRA).  
```
$ scp -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa strainA_1.fastq test07@ftp-private.ddbj.nig.ac.jp:~/test07-0018
```

Enter the passphrase (if setted for the key).
```
Enter passphrase for key '/home/you/.ssh/id_rsa': 
```

You can directly handle the uploaded files by logging in the server.   
SSH login the server by executing,  
```
$ ssh -i <Your private key> <D-way Login ID>@ftp-private.ddbj.nig.ac.jp
```

Example commands.  
```
$ ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa test07@ftp-private.ddbj.nig.ac.jp
```

Enter the passphrase (if setted for the key).
```
Enter passphrase for key '/home/you/.ssh/id_rsa':
```

After logging in successfully, the following prompt is displayed.
```
[test07@at056 ~]$ 
```

The login environment is private for the submitter. Users other than the submitter cannot access the data.  
Executable commands are restricted to the following ones. Users can delete unnecessary files.  
```
ls cd cp mv rm more mkdir tar gzip gunzip bzip2 bunzip2 zip unzip
```
