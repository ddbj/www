## Introduction  {#introduction}

The AMED Genome group sharing Database (AGD) is a service for archiving and sharing of all types of individual-level genetic and de-identified
phenotypic data within research project and group members. DDBJ center and the [Database Center for Life Science](https://dbcls.rois.ac.jp/index-en.html) of [Research Organization of Information and Systems](https://dbcls.rois.ac.jp/index-en.html) promote public (un-restricted and restricted) sharing of human data while protecting personal information, we have launched AGD to enable sharing of human data with research project and group members before publication.

AGD service is hosted by DDBJ Group Cloud in collaboration with [Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED)](http://www.amed.go.jp/en/). In the AMED data sharing policy applied to several AMED-funded research projects, a new data sharing mechanism "Group Sharing" has been introduced to the NBDC Human Database in addition to the "restricted sharing" and "un-restricted sharing". The "Group Sharing" enables data sharing at earlier research stage and AGD is specified by AMED as one of databases for group sharing.  
Submission and data access requests are reviewed by the [Human Data Review Board](https://biosciencedbc.jp/en/about-us/organization/dac/).

## Data access  {#access}

The data access request is reviewed by [DBCLS](http://gr-sharingdbs.biosciencedbc.jp/agd-guidelines). The users apply for data access to the [DBCLS](http://gr-sharingdbs.biosciencedbc.jp/agd-guidelines) and the AGD will only facilitate secure access to the data once the information of a successful application process has been passed from the DBCLS to the AGD.

## Data submission  {#submission}

The AGD accepts only de-identified data approved by DBCLS ([Data submission of human subjects research](/policies-e.html#submission-of-human-data)). The users apply for data submission to the [DBCLS](https://gr-sharingdbs.biosciencedbc.jp/agd-data-submission) and the AGD will only accept and process submissions once the information of a successful application process has been passed from the DBCLS to the AGD. Prior to data submission, the submitters should [contact the AGD](/contact-ddbj-e.html). A separate notification will then be sent to the submitter including the instructions of how to upload the data into AGD.

After data submission the AGD team will process the data into databases and archive the original data files. The accepted data types include manufacturer-specific raw data formats from the array-based and new sequencing platforms. The processed data such as the genotype and structural variants or any summary level statistical analyses from the original study authors are stored in databases. The AGD also accepts and distributes any phenotype data associated with the samples.
