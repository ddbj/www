        <td>Data owner requires and indicates to INSDC staff that confidentiality is required until a release date or publication in the literature, whichever comes earlier.</td>
        <td>Data are not available publicly through any means. A data release date is recorded for the data, which are subsequently and automatically released as <strong>Public</strong> on <strong>reaching this date</strong> or <strong>being cited online</strong> or <strong>in a publication prior to this date</strong>. In the event that a release date must be extended, data owners are required to follow the submission database's guidelines on how to extend the release of their data. Alternatively, please contact the INSDC partner responsible for the submission with sufficient notice<span class="bold red">*</span>.</td>

      	<th id="suppressed">Suppressed</th>
        <td>(1) Data are found by the owner to be incorrectly annotated or contaminated with no immediate opportunity on the part of the owner to be updated.<br><br>
        (2) Data owners realise after sequences have been released that they failed to request a confidential status, either at the time of submission, or within the period between completion of submission processing and the date on which the submission is normally made available to the public (this time period can vary among the INSDC members).</td>
        <td>Data are removed where possible from direct search tools (such as text and sequence similarity search) but remain available by accession number.</td>

      <tr>
      	<th id="replaced">Replaced</th>
        <td>Data owners generate new data under new accession identifiers that directly replace existing data; this is expected to be rare since replacement data normally use the existing accession identifiers for the records that they replace.</td>
        <td>Data are removed where possible from direct search tools (such as text and sequence similarity search) but remain available by accession number. Where possible, look-up by original accession identifiers leads to a re-direct to new records available under the new accession identifiers.</td>

      <tr>
      	<th id="killed">Killed</th>
        <td>(1) The submitter has requested a <strong>Confidential</strong> status or an extension to an existing release date, but the INSDC, or a submissions brokering collaborator, has failed to apply the appropriate release date correctly.<br><br>
        (2) Data are found to have been submitted to the databases without the permission of the rightful owner; this is expected to be extremely rare and requires formal institutional contact with the submitting institution.</td>
        <td>Data are not directly available publicly from INSDC partners through <strong>any means</strong>. However, because the data will have been distributed previously as <strong>Public</strong>, the INSDC partners cannot exercise any control on the resultant use of the data by third parties.</td>
