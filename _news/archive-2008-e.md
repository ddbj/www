Meanwhile, DDBJ has introduced ARSA at the scientific meeting and DDBJing tutorials. The increase of ARSA users reflects these efforts, and as a result, DDBJ decided to terminate providing SRS service.<br>DDBJ will do all the more efforts for the development of ARSA. If you have any comments for ARSA, please send it from "Your Comment" which is located in the upper blue zone.</p></div>

  <div class="news_date">June 06,2008</div>
  <div class="news_content">In May 2008, the total number of bases ( DNA and RNA ) collected and distributed by INSD ( International Nucleotide Sequence Database: DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank ) has reached 200 G bases (200,000,000,000 bases; the 'letters' of the genetic code). It took only three years from <a href="/whatsnew/2005-e.html#050921">when we had reached 100G bases on August 2005</a>.<br><br>INSD has expanded its specifications to accept data submissions from large scale sequencing projects. For example, we have started accepting the sequence data from EST (Expressed Sequence Tags) projects into EST <a href="/ddbj/flat-file.html#LocusB#division">division</a> since 1993. On 2002, to accept submissions of the draft genome and the meta-genome sequences, we have created the new category for <a href="/ddbj/wgs.html">WGS (Whole Genome Shotgun)</a> data.<br><br>The left figure shows the relationship of the ratios of three categories. The right figure shows the numbers of bases.<br><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/news/200G-08060602.PNG" class="w600"><p>As you can see in the right figure, base counts of both WGS and EST/GSS (Genome Survey Sequences) data increased approximately two times during three years. The base count of WGS data has increased 100 G bases only past 6 years.</p><p><br><b>What is WGS data?</b><br>In general the term, WGS "Whole Genome Shotgun", originally means an approach to sequence genomic DNA molecules that are once fragmented into millions of pieces, which are sequenced and reassembled to produce a series of sequences,. The strategy was firstly adopted to sequence the complete genome of Haemophilus influenzae in 1995. In INSD, the large set of contigs or the finished sequences without annotation from the proceeding genome project can be accepted as WGS data.<br><br><b>Future improvement</b><br>Increasingly High-Throughput Sequencing (HTS) technology (also called the next generation sequencers) is gaining popularity. It will accelerate the increase ratio of sequence data submitted to DDBJ. For the vast quantities of future submissions, DDBJ has to improve our database systems.<br><br>NCBI has started making SRA (Short Read Archive) to collect the raw outputs of short piece data derived from the next-generation sequencer, such as 454, Solexa, SOLiD and so on. As well as EBI, DDBJ is planning to collaborate with SRA.<br>Related to the new sequencing technologies, INSD faces many requests for the deposition of assembled EST (or EST-like short piece of) sequences. Therefore we will prepare a new division, TSA (Transcriptome Shotgun Assembly), to accept assembled sequences derived from transcriptome projects.<br><br>The day of reaching to 300 G bases<br>In February 2008, NIH announced about <a href="http://www.nih.gov/news/health/jan2008/nhgri-22.htm" target="_blank">the 1000 Genomes Project</a>, and they already sequenced human genome data between 200 to 300 G bases in their count. Related to this kind of project, it is not enough for DDBJ to accept huge scale of nucleotide sequences.<br><br>Because research communities require not only the text based nucleotide sequences, but also the raw outputs of trace data for the sequences to investigate reliabilities of sequence data, evaluation of polymorphisms among individuals and so on. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/trace.cgi" target="_blank">Trace Archive</a> has accepted huge number of trace data registration, more than tens of terabytes (1013 order) in their total size. Last year, DDBJ started to accept a part of trace data from Japanese researchers for the first trial. It is supported by <a href="http://dbcls.rois.ac.jp/" target="_blank">the Integrated Database Project</a>.<br><br>Research analyses of large scale sequences will intend to the peta byte (1015 order) data. Considering with only the size of sequence data in INSD (i.e. excluding SRA and Trace Archive), the number of nucleotides is possible to be 400 G bases or more in one and a half year later.</p></div>

  <div class="news_date">February 01,2008</div>
  <div class="news_content">In February 2007, DDBJ replaced the computer system and upgraded some of the application programs. In the meantime, DDBJ has been required to process millions of entries. The question here is if the new system has been able to satisfy the emerging requirements.<br><br>You might recognize that you can hold your entries in a certain period or until the relevant paper are published. DDBJ should not disclose these Hold-Until-Published entries to the public. To retain them inside DDBJ, DDBJ stores these entries in a separate server from servers for data dissemination, e.g. getentry server.<br><br>In the daily data release procedure shown in the following figure, DDBJ convert entries into the flat file format from the server for in-house data management to transfer them to other servers for such services to the public as <a href="http://getentry.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/top-e.html" target="_blank">getentry</a>, <a href="http://arsa.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/top-e.html" target="_ blank">ARSA</a>, <a href="/services-e.html" target="_blank">homology search</a> and <a href="ftp://ftp.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/" target="_blank">anonymous FTP</a><br><br><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/news/tairyou080201-e.gif"><br><br>This month (January 2008), DDBJ released about 1,500,000 entries only in two days; about 1,000,000 entries in the first day, and about 500,000 entries in the second day. It is to be noted that this process was completed as smoothly as designed. With the previous system, we were able to process only 350,000 entries in a day, namely, we had to spend more than 4 days to complete 1.5M entries.<br><br>Although the mission was completed this time, we learned some lessons to improve the procedure further. You may claim that "2 days" is not quick enough. The system engineers in charge started the discussion to improve the concordance of several servers to gain higher throughput than ever.<br><br>We would appreciate it very much, if you remember the group of hard working system engineers especially when you see the announcement of massive data release.</div>
