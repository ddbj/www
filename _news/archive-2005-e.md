  <div class="news_date">December 15,2005</div>
  <div class="news_content"><dd>The RAP-DB, database for highly curated rice annotations was developed and opened to the public by Natioanal Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, and National Institute of Genetics.<dd>The Rice genome (<i>Oryza sativa</i> ssp. <i>japonica</i> cultivar Nipponbare) was completely sequenced by the IRGSP (International Rice Genome Sequencing Project), in December 2004, and Japan has been taking a leading role of this project. Now rice researchers are in new paradigm, namely "post-genome" (IRGSP, <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v436/n7052/full/nature03895.html" target="_blank"> Nature. 2005 Aug 11;436 (7052):793 - 800</a> ).<dd>With the completion of the rice genome sequencing, an annotation project has been promoted with the aim of annotating and manually curating all the genes in the rice genome, gathering numbers of rice researchers and annotators from all over the world (Itoh et al., manuscript in preparation).<dd>The Rice Annotation Project Database (RAP-DB) is to feedback this invaluable information to the rice research community (Ohyanagi et al., Nucleic Acids Research Database Issue 2006, in press). The RAP-DB has two different types of annotation viewers, search features with keyword or sequence homology. By connecting the annotations to other rice genomics data, such as full-length cDNAs and <i>Tos17</i> mutant lines, the RAP-DB serves as a "hub" for rice genomics.<dd>All of the resources can be accessed through http://rapdb.lab.nig.ac.jp/.<dd>(References)<dd><ul><li><a href="http://rgp.dna.affrc.go.jp/IRGSP/" target="_blank">IRGSP(International Rice Genome Sequencing Project)</a></li><li><a href="http://rgp.dna.affrc.go.jp/IRGSP/Build4/build4.html" target="_blank">IRGSP Release (Build4.0) (2005.8.31)</a></li><li>DDBJ HP: Link to Other web pages on Information Biology (databases for Rice)    </li></ul></dd></dd></dd></dd></dd></dd></dd></div>

  <div class="news_content"><dd>The world's three leading public repositories for DNA and RNA sequence information have reached 100 gigabases (100,000,000,000 bases; the 'letters' of the genetic code) of sequence. Thanks to their data exchange policy, which has paved the way for the global exchange of many types of biological information, the three members of <a href="http://www.insdc.org/" target="_blank">the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC, www.insdc.org)</a>,<a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/embl/" target="_blank">EMBL-Bank (Hinxton,UK)</a>, <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Genbank/index.html">GenBank (Bethesda, USA)</a> and the <a href="/index-e.html">DNA Data Bank of Japan(Mishima, Japan)</a> all reached this milestone together.<dd>Takashi Gojobori, Director of the Center for Information Biology and <a href="/Welcome-e.html">DNA Data Bank of Japan</a>, says: "The INSDC has laid the foundations for the exchange of many types of biological information: as we enter the era of systems biology and researchers begin to exchange complex types of information such as the results of experiments that measure the activities of thousands of genes, or computational models of entire processes, it is important to celebrate the achievements of the three databases that pioneered the open exchange of biological information."<dd>Graham Cameron, Associate Director of EMBL's <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/">European Bioinformatics Institute</a>, says "This is an important milestone in the history of the nucleotide sequence databases; From the first EMBL Data Library entry made available in 1982 to today's provision of over 55 million sequence entries from at least 200,000 different organisms, these resources have anticipated the needs of molecular biologists and addressed them - often in the face of a serious lack of resources."<dd>David Lipman, Director of <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/">the National Center for Biotechnology Information</a>, adds: "Today's nucleotide sequence databases allow researchers to share completed genomes, the genetic make-up of entire ecosystems, and sequences associated with patents. The INSDC has realized the vision of the researchers who initiated the sequence database projects, by making the global sharing of nucleotide sequence information possible."<dd>EMBL-Bank and GenBank had started International Nucleotide Sequence Database activities in 1980, and DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ) had joined in its activities as a third collaborative partner in 1987. DDBJ has received data submission from all the countries of the world, mainly from Japan.  By exchanging the collected data with another 2 databanks, DDBJ has contributed to the development of International Nucleotide Sequence Database collaboration.<dd>For details of DDBJ, please refer to <a href="/%20">http://www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/</a>.</dd></dd></dd></dd></dd></dd></div>

Macaca fascicularis cDNA database (QFbase) was constructed by  JCRB Genebank, National Institute of Biomedical Innovation, Japan, under collaborative research with Laboratory for DNA Data Analysis, CIB-DDBJ, National Institute of Genetics, Japan;<br>    Division of Genetic Diagnosis, <a href="http://www.ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp/imswww/index-e.html">Institite of Medical Sciences</a> and Department of Medical Genome Sciences, University of Tokyo, Japan. <dd>The database provides about 85,000 5' or 3' EST sequences of cynomolgus monkey cDNA libraries derived from the brain, liver, and testis. About 4,000 full-length cDNA sequences are also included in the database and 1,700 of them contain the information for human-macaque difference in the protein coding region.<dd>Accession numbers released from DDBJ are BB873801 - BB894695 (20895 entries, 3'EST) and CJ430287 - CJ493524 (63238 entries, 5'EST). These entries can be retrievable via DDBJ <a href="http://getentry.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/top-e.html">getentry</a>     system.<dd>The cDNA clones are ready to be provided though <a href="http://www.jhsf.or.jp/English/index_e.html">Human Science Research Resource Bank (HSRRB)</a> for further functinal experiments.<dd>All data are available at http://genebank.nibio.go.jp/gbank/index_e.html.<dd>This "QFbase" is also intorduced atLink to DDBJ/CIB web pages on Information Biology and Link to Other web pages on Information Biology: Databases for Other Mammals pages.

  <div class="news_date">June 10,2005</div>
  <div class="news_content"><dd>DDBJ has provided the XML formatted data (DDBJ-XML*) at its anonymous FTP site and its sequence retrieval getentry system since 2001. Additionally, since April 29 of this year, INSD-XML formatted data have been also provided by DDBJ, although as a trial**. INSD-XML is one of the DTD (Data Type Definition), which is commonly used by the International Nucleotide Sequence Databases (INSD) being comprised by DDBJ, EMBL, and GenBank, for their data releases.<dd>* DDBJ-XML was designed aiming for the generation of documents making easier computer program manipulation and being also readable by humans. It is based on the concept of "flat file format", which has been widely used so far. Meanwhile, INSD-XML was designed focusing on Features/qualifiers structure rather than having familiarity with the Flat File format. <dd>** Although INSD-XML was released to the public, the INSD Collaborative (INSDC) databases will confirm that there are no problems regarding the data exchange for all entries, and also will ensure that it is possible to write/read XML documents in a common format within one year. Therefore, in some cases, DTD itself might be changed and/or some changes might be done at the stage of the development from DTD to XML document. Anonymous FTP directories and file names released at DDBJ web pages are as shown below. At the present stage, available data from the anonymous FTP site is only daily updated for new data. Periodical release data will appear on next DDBJ release 62 (June, 2005).<dd><b>Use of INSD-XML at FTP</b><dd> URL : ftp.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/database/ddbjnew/xml/insd/<dd> File name : DDBJNEWr##.XXX.insd_xml.gz (e.g. DDBJNEWr61.062.insd_xml.gz)<dd>(## release number, XXX serial number)<dd>  Release number and serial number are the same as daily updated anonymous FTP data. <dd>  TPA and CON data are also released in one file. <dd>  DTD for INSD-XML is INSD_INSDSeq.dtd, which is located in the same directory<dd><b>USE of INSD-XML at getentry</b><dd>If you select "INSD-XML" from DNA databases box, you will obtain the data in INSD-XML format.</dd></dd></dd></dd></dd></dd></dd></dd></dd></dd></dd></dd></div>

  <div class="news_content"><dd>Brachyury, T-box domain containing transcription factor, was evolutionary conserved among animals and play an important role in embryonic development. To characterize Brachyury-downstream genes, Brachyury-downstream gene database, "NotoBase" was constructed by Kyoto University, Molecular and Evolutionary Developmental Biology and National Institute of Genetics, Center for Information Biology and DNA Data Bank of Japan. This database contains the annotation information for approximately 500 Brachyury downstream genes isolated by subtraction method. It is able for us to access such information that corresponding EST/cDNA/Genome sequences, more than 3000 pictures of gene expression pattern and homology information with BLAST. It also supports various searching (homology searching for gene expression pattern and keyword searching for the result with the BLAST). In addition, sequences of the Brachyury-downstream genes can be available from "Download" site.<dd>  - NotoBase: http://ciona.lab.nig.ac.jp/notochord/cibra/index.htm</dd></dd></div>

  <div class="news_date">January 24,2005</div>
  <div class="news_content"><dd>The International Nucleotide Sequence Databases (INSD) discussed the issue of receiving and releasing huge amounts of transcript sequence, each of which is a 5' end short-length transcript approximately 20 bp in length. They are produced by the CAGE (Cap Analysis Genome Expression) method and thus called the CAGE sequences.  INSD then agreed that the sequences be submitted and released as a new category, MGA (Mass sequence for Genome Annotation), because the sequences are of new type and not fit to any of the extant divisions or categories.<dd> <dd><b>Definition of MGA</b><dd>MGA is defined as those sequences which are produced in large quantity in view of genome annotation.<dd> <dd>The first set of MGA was released on January 24, 2005.  The MGA data for mouse were submitted from Dr. Yoshihide Hayashizaki and his colleagues of the Genome Sciences Center at RIKEN.  The total number of sequence entries this time is 383,264.  The MGA data can be downloaded at the ftp site,<dd> <dd>URL:<a href="ftp://ftp.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/ddbj_database/mga/project_index.html">ftp://ftp.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/ddbj_database/mga/project_index.html</a><dd> <dd>You can jump to the above ftp site from "<a href="/download-e.html">Anonymous FTP of the DDBJ</a>" page of DDBJ HP.<dd>Most of the present MGA sequences are associated with the gene expression data which have already been released at CIBEX (<a href="//cibex.nig.ac.jp/data/index.html">http://cibex.nig.ac.jp/index.jsp</a>), one of the international gene expression databases, operated at the Center for Information Biology and DNA Data Bank of Japan.</dd></dd></dd></dd></dd></dd></dd></dd></dd></dd></dd></div>
