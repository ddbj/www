[Third Party (TPA) sequence records](/ddbj/tpa-e.html ) were initially intended to capture 
experimentally (TPA:experimental) or inferentially (TPA:inferential) confirmed annotations that were not 
previously submitted to INSDC with the initial primary sequence record.    
All TPA records require a peer-review publication for describing the analysis done to generate the annotations .    

Please note that due to the complexity of the submission process and changes to the technology used to analyze data, 
INSDC will no longer accept new submissions of type TPA: experimental and TPA: inferential after January 2025.     
We will continue to accept new TPA-assembly sequences.
