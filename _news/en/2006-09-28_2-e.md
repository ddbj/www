<html>
<dd>getentry is the entry retrieval system by accession numbers etc, which is provided by DDBJ via WWW and E-mail servers.
<dd>Recently, we found there were some entries, which had not been displayed on <a href="http://getentry.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/top-e.html">the web version of getentry</a> for a certain period (see below for details).
<dd>The problem entries are contig entries released by DDBJ and GenBank. They include a part of the CON 7269 entries, corresponding to <a href="2006-e.html#060421wgs">the release of 223 thousands WGS entries of the Medaka strain Hd-rR</a>, released by DDBJ on April 20, 2006.
<dd>We kindly request users to conduct their searches again if you have used the web version of getentry in the affected period, using the relevant keywords. Currently, the web version of getentry works normally.
<dd>Fortunately, the e-mail version of getentry was not affected by this trouble.
<dd>Details are as follows:
