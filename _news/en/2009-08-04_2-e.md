At first, DDBJ apologize the accidental suspension of DDBJ's Homology Search and ClustalW services which was broken out in the early morning of August 2, 2009.

<p>After the investigation, some queries might not had returned the correct results because of the trouble of the target databases caused by the service suspension. Therefore, DDBJ asks the users who had submitted the queries during the following period to re-submit again. At present, DDBJ's Homology Search and ClustalW services works normally and returns the correct results.</p>

<ul>
    <li>period : Aug 2, 2009 around 6:00(JST) - Aug 3, 2009 17:40(JST)</li>
</ul>
