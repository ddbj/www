<dd>GIB (Genome Information Broker) provides an integrated search of Bacteria, Archaea, Eukaryota complete genome sequences.
<dd>Because the genome sequence data of <i>Bordetella avium 197N</i> (by Sanger Institute), <i>Frankia alni ACN14a</i> (by Genoscope) were released, we incorporated them to GIB, and now you can search those data.</dd>
