For migration to the new supercomputer, the BioProject/BioSample/DRA/GEA submission services have been suspended since 14th September 2021. 
These services were planned to be [resumed on 16th](https://www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/news/en/2021-08-27-e.html), however, will be resumed after the hardware troubles are fixed.

Please note that getentry, BLAST and FTP search are available but they do not have the latest data.
