<dd>GIB (Genome Information Broker)<br> provides an integrated search of Bacteria, Archaea, Eukaryota complete<br> genome sequences.<br> Because the genome sequence data of <i>Staphylococcus aureus subsp. aureus<br> NCTC 8325</i> (by The University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center) and<br> <i>Methanospirillum hungatei JF-1</i> (by Joint Genome Institute) were<br> released, we incorporated them to GIB, and now you can search those data.</dd>
