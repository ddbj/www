Since 13:00 on August 13, 2025, a problem has occurred in [uploading data](/upload-e.html) via sftp to ftp-private.ddbj.nig.ac.jp using newly created [DDBJ accounts](/ddbj-account-e.html), result in errors such as "permission denied" and uploads failed. Uploads are possible with existing accounts.   
We apologize for the inconvenience. We will announce on our website once the problem has been resolved.
