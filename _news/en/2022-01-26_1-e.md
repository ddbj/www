For all users of DDBJ,    
    
Until now, we have posted release news of large-scale sequence data submitted to DDBJ, such as whole genomes, 
transcriptomes, or some others mainly derived from eukaryotes. However, with the prevalence of next-generation 
sequencers, large-scale sequence analyses have become more familiar. So, we stop posting the announcements for them.
<br>
Sequence data are released on a daily basis, so we hope that you continue using DDBJ services for search tools.

Thank you very much for your continued support.
