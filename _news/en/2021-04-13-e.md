The JGA system released at September, 2020, has employed scp as the data transfer protocol with IP address restriction.     
To improve usability and security, the protocol will be switched from scp to sftp at 10:00 22th April 2021.    
After the switching, how to upload and download data files by sftp will be explained in the [JGA submission steps](/jga/submission-step-e.html) and the [Download steps](/jga/download-e.html) web pages.
