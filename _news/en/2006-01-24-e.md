<dd>The complete genome sequence of <i>Escherichia coli</i> K-12 strain W3110<br> was released from DDBJ. Accession number is<br> <a href="http://getentry.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/cgi-bin/get_entry.pl?AP009048" target="_AP009048">AP009048</a>.
<dd>As to <i>E. coli</i> K-12 genome, the annotation workshop,<br> Monica Riley of <a href="http://www.mbl.edu/" target="_blank"><br> Marine Biological Laboratory (MBL)</a> worked as a leader,<br> was held in 2003 and 2005 at MBL. From Japan, the researchers of<br> NAIST,<br> NIBB<br> and DDBJ participated in the workshop. An accurate and<br> completeness annotation were assigned to the most recent and<br> exact genome sequences of two <i>E. coli</i> K-12 strains<br> (strain W3110 and MG1655 whose genome sequences were<br> determined in Japan and U.S.A, respectively).
<dd>The result of the workshop has been already published as a paper in<br> Nucleic Acids Research.

<dd><i>E. coli</i> is one of the most important organisms for<br> various biological fields, such as molecular biology, genome<br> sequencing, systems biology, etc. The release of accurate and<br> completeness <i>E. coli</i> genome annotation provide<br> researchers with meaningful information in the science field.
