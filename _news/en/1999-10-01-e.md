<dd>DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank International Nucleotide Sequence Database decided to introduce sequence version number (version line for nucleotide sequences and /protein_id for amino acid sequences) at the collaborators meeting held at Mishima this year.<br>Because of this change, DDBJ will eliminate NID and PID, which are currently included in the DDBJ database entries, starting DDBJ release 39 (Oct. 1999).Before that release, entries which will be open after September 30 will no longer have NID nor PID.PID and NID will be eliminated from all the entries after distribution of DDBJ release 39.</dd>
