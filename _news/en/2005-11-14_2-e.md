<dd>GIB (Genome Information Broker) provides an integrated search of Bacteria, Archaea, Eukaryota complete genome sequences. Because the genome sequence data of <i>Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942</i> and <i>Lactobacillus sakei subsp. sakei 23K</i> (by JGI) were released, we incorporated them to GIB, and now you can search those data.</dd>
