<dd>The <i>C. elegans</i> sequencing project has completed the fifteen year project to sequence the complete genome of the nematode worm <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> (about 97 million bp). This project is a collaboration between<a href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/C_elegans/">the Sanger Centre</a>, Hinxton Hall, Cambridge and <a href="http://genome.wustl.edu/gsc/gschmpg.html">the Genome Sequencing Center</a> at the Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis. It was published on Science Vol. 282 No, 5396, pp. 2011-2046.<br>
<dd>These sequence data were submitted to the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank International Nucleotide Sequence Database. You can search those data through the DDBJ WWW server.</dd>
