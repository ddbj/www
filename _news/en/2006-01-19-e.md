<dd>GIB (Genome Information Broker)<br> provides an integrated search of Bacteria, Archaea, Eukaryota complete<br> genome sequences.<br> Because the genome sequence data of <i>Sodalis glossinidius morsitans</i><br> (by Kitasato University) and <i>Aster yellows witches'-broom phytoplasma<br> AYWB</i> (by The Ohio State University) were released, we incorporated<br> them to GIB, and now you can search those data.</dd>
