<dd>GIB (Genome Information Broker) provides an integrated search of Bacteria, Archaea, Eukaryota complete genome sequences. Because the genome sequence data of <i>Burkholderia sp. 383</i> (by JGI), <i>Carboxydothermus hydrogenoformans Z-2901</i> (by TIGR), <i>Pelobacter carbinolicus DSM 2380</i> (by JGI) and <i>Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria 85-10</i> (by Institut fuer genetik) were released, we incorporated them to GIB, and now you can search those data.</dd>
