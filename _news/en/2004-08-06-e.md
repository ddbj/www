<dd><a href="/services/past-services-e.html#gib">GIB (Genome Information Broker)</a> provides an integrated search of Bacteria, Archaea, Eukaryota complete genome sequences. Because the genome sequence data of <i>Leifsonia xyli subsp. xyli CTCB07</i> was released by University of Campinas, we incorporated it to GIB, and now you can search those data.
