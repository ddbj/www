<a href="http://gtps.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/index.php" target="_blank">GTPS (Gene Trek Prokaryote Space)</a> is a re-annotated database which includes public prokaryotic genome sequences and those annotation. Especially, candidates of ORFs are validated and ranked based on a stable and consistent protocol. GTPS has been updated every year. The latest GTPS which includes 690 strains was opened to the public on Mar. 25, 2009. This time, a common menu was installed in top page, genome viewer and feature viewer in addition to the updating of database. Furthermore, <a href="http://gtps.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/procedure/index.php" target="_blank">the page which explains the procedure of analysis</a> was also opened to the public.<br>
