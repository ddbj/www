<dd>As of November 6, 11:00, in DDBJ, there is a serious delivery delay of E-mails. Therefore, at present, DDBJ can not (or takes a lot of time) receive inquiry from DDBJ users. This is caused by the attack of a large amount of SPAM mails since November 3, 2006 (Fri) 19:00. If you need a quick response from DDBJ, please understand the present situation.
<dd>Thank you very much for your understanding and cooperation.</dd>
