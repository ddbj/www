At 17th May 2023, DDBJ BioSample implemented two changes.  
Both changes is one of [INSDC](https://www.insdc.org/)'s efforts to improve utility of sequence data and sample traceability.

## null value reporting {#null}

The way of null value reporting was changed at DDBJ BioSample.  
Reporting by "missing" or "not collected" was allowed for required attributes when values are missing. However, one of eight "reporting level terms" is required to follow the term "missing".

Before    
* missing

After   
* missing: control sample
* missing: sample group
* missing: synthetic construct
* missing: lab stock
* missing: third party data
* missing: data agreement established pre-2023
* missing: endangered species
* missing: human-identifiable

See [Missing value reporting](/biosample/submission-e.html#missing-value-reporting) for details.

## Sample location, collection date and time {#spatio-tempo}

DDBJ BioSample made sample location and collection date description mandatory.  

* Location of collection: Specification of where the biological sample was collected, at a minimum, by using the names for countries, oceans, or seas. Relevant attribute is BioSample [geo_loc_name](/biosample/attribute-e.html#geo_loc_name).
* Date and time of collection: Date and time when the specimen was collected, at least to the nearest year. Relevant attribute is BioSample [collection_date](/biosample/attribute-e.html#collection_date).

See [Sample attributes](/biosample/attribute-e.html) for details.
