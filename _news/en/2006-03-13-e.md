<dd>"getentry" is the entry retrieval system by accession numbers etc, which<br> is provided by DDBJ via WWW and E-mail servers.
<dd>In the getentry web server, to obtain the results, there are 3 ways<br> (interactively, by E-mail, by anonymous FTP) provided. Among them, when<br> "anonymous FTP" is selected, up to 100,000 entries can be downloaded as<br> anonymous FTP by clicking the file name shown in the screen. Although it<br> may take a lot of time to make the result file for anonymous FTP in case<br> of a big volume file, there has been a problem that the progress of the<br> file making could not been checked so far.
<dd>To solve this problem, since March 13, 2006, the following 2 functions<br> are newly equipped for the anonymous FTP.

    <ol>
        <li><b>Check of the status of the file making</b><br> please click "the state of making the file" in the lower frame part,<br> then the message showing the file making status are displayed.</li>
        <li><b>Sending the E-mail notifying the completion of the file making for<br> FTP</b><br> If you enter your E-mail address, the E-mail to notify the completion<br> of the file making will be sent to you. </li>
    </ol>
<dd>Both are very useful when you use anonymous FTP to obtain the getentry<br> retrieval results.</dd>
