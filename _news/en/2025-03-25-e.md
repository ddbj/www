We are sorry to announce that our “Service suspension period due to NIG supercomputer replacement” still continues for many services. I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience and troubles caused to all users.    
    
The following services will continue to be suspended:    
    
**[Submission  service]**
- DDBJ Nucleotide Sequence Submission System
- MSS form
- D-way
  - BioProject
  - BioSample
  - DRA
  - GEA
  - GEA reviewer access
  - DRA/GEA/MSS/MetaboBank SFTP (ftp-private.ddbj.nig.ac.jp) services
  - Because of the D-way account system downtime, the following services will be unavailable.
    - D-way New account creation
    - D-way Account information update
    - D-way Password change
- DRA/GEA validation
- JGA/AGD
- Metabobank

The suspension is due to a setting failure of our new supercomputer system, and we plan to resume all services from April 3rd. We will also inform the status of our web services upon restarting.    
    
Thank you for your continued support of DDBJ.
