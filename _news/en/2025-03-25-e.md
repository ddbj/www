We are sorry that the previously announced "Service suspension period due to NIG supercomputer replacement" has been extended for some services. I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience and troubles caused to users.    
    
The following services will continue to be suspended:    
    
**[Submission  service]**
- DDBJ Nucleotide Sequence Submission System
- MSS form
- D-way
  - BioProject
  - BioSample
  - DRA
  - GEA
  - GEA reviewer access
  - DRA/GEA/MSS/MetaboBank SFTP (ftp-private.ddbj.nig.ac.jp) services
  - Because of the D-way account system downtime, the following services will be unavailable.
    - D-way New account creation
    - D-way Account information update
    - D-way Password change
- DRA/GEA validation
- JGA/AGD
- Metabobank
- NBDC Application System
- NBDC Group Sharing Database Application System

**[Search service]**
- MetaboBank Search
    
The cause is due to a setting failure of the new supercomputer system, and we plan to resume all services after 4/3. We will inform you about each service on our website as soon as it is resumed.    
    
Thank you for your continued support of DDBJ.    
    
Masanori Arita, Director of Bioinformation and DDBJ Center
