<span class="red">23rd April 2025, this trouble has been resolved.</span>

In MSS Form, if you cannot see transition screen after clicking "Next", please try the following at first.

* Delete cached images and files saved in internet browser
* Change the internet browser to another one, or try the submission in a different PC, if possible
* Try the submission using the 'Secret mode' or 'In-private mode' of the browser

If you cannot solve the problem, please let us know by selecting "DDBJ: Mass Submission System (MSS)" from the [DDBJ Center Contact Form](https://www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/contact-ddbj-e.html)
   
We appreciate your understanding.
