<dd><a href="http://getentry.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/top-e.html">getentry</a> is the data retrieval system provided by<br>DDBJ through web and E-mail.
<dd>Recently, we found there were some entries, which had not been displayed at the getentry for a certain period. Details are as follows;

    <ul>
        <li><b>Affected periods:</b> February 1, 2007 - September 13, 2007</li>
        <li><b>Undisplayable entries:</b>(<a href="/files/pdf/mikoukai_20071022.zip">--&gt;see the accession numbers list</a>)</li>
        <li><b>Measures:</b>The undisplayed data had been modified on September 13, 2007, and currently, all the data can be displayed.<br></li>
    </ul>
<dd>We deeply apologize for any inconveniences that this may have caused to our users.<br>We will try to set the preventive measures to cope with these troubles immediately.</dd>
