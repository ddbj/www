<p>The Bioinformation and DDBJ Center and its partners in the International Nucleotide Database Collaboration (INSDC) have joined together to issue a statement encouraging the scientific community to submit their SARS-CoV-2 sequences to INSDC databases. The databases offer broad open access and integrated data â€“ features that we believe are critical as the research community works together to understand and combat COVID-19.</p>

<p>Read <a href="http://www.insdc.org/sites/insdc.org/files/documents/INSDC_Statement_on_SARS-CoV-2_sequence_data_sharing_during_COVID-19.pdf">the full statement on the INSDC website</a>.</p>
