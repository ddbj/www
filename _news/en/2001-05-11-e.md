<dd>DDBJ introduced XML for the data dissemination and named it DDBJ-XML. XML format is firstly implemented into a DDBJ search program named <a href="http://getentry.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/top-e.html">"getentry"</a>.<br>
<dd>You could choose XML format from a pull-down menu of "getentry".<br>
<dd>You could also find a link to the DTD file when you get the result of "getentry".<br>
