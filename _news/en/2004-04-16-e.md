<dd>H-Invitational (Human Full-length cDNA Annotation Invitational) is an international project that human full-length cDNA (complementaryDNA) were performed various bioinformatics analysis and then were assigned a functional annotation, a secondary and tertiary structure of a predicted protein on a cDNA, expression profiles and so on.<br>
<dd>The project have been joint-sponsored by the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), Japan Biological Research Information Center (JBIRC), the Japan Biological Informatics Consortium (JBIC) and the Center for Information Biology and DNA Data Bank of Japan (CIB-DDBJ) National Institute of Genetics, that's now Research Organization of Information and Systems National Institute of Genetics.<br>
<dd>The CIB-DDBJ constructs the database, named H-Invitational Database CIB-DDBJ Flat File Server, to release and get a results on functional annotation assigned to full-length cDNA in flat file compatible with the DDBJ flat file format of International Nucleotide Sequence Database with some modification. The Flat Files were prepared by both CIB-DDBJ and JBIRC, called as DDBJ version Flat File and JBIRC version Flat File, respectively, and XML Files was also only made by JBIRC for all of cDNA and LOCUS entries.<br>
<dd>All DDBJ and JBIRC version Flat File and XML Files of data can be accessed and downloaded on FTP site.<br>
<dd>H-Invitational Database (H-Inv DB) developed by JBIRC is also being released at CIB-DDBJ as mirroring site.<br><br>
