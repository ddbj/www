<p>New BioProject, BioSample and DRA submission system were released at 8th, April (Wed).</p>

<p>This system enhancement was carried out by funding from <a href="http://www.genome-sci.jp/">MEXT Genome Science</a>.</p>

<p>Tutorial video.[youtube id="Hg4h8ytbIV4" title="Submission to BioProject, BioSample and DRA"]</p>

<p><a href="/dra/services/index.html">DRA Handbook</a></p>

<p>The new system is able to reference and submit BioProject, BioSample and DRA submissions which had been registered in the former system. </p>

<h3>BioProject, BioSample and DRA data can be submitted at once</h3>

<p>Before submission to DRA, BioProject and BioSample accession numbers were required.In the new system, BioProject, BioSample and DRA data can be submitted at once, so submitters need not to wait for BioProject and BioSample accession numbers.</p>

<p>Experiment and Run which are same number of BioSample, are automatically created.Submitter and hold action in the DRA submission are copied to "SUBMITTER" of BioProject and BioSample.</p>

<h3>Registered BioSample attributes text file is available in D-way</h3>

<p>Users can download the registered BioSample attributes text file in D-way (blue box).Updates will be reflected to the file.

<h3>Reference sequence of bam can be specified by accession number</h3>

<p>Reference sequence in single fasta file was required to submit alignment data in bam.</p>

<p>In the new system, if references are found in <a href="ftp://ftp-trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/refseq/">ftp://ftp-trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/refseq/</a>,references can be specified by their accession numbers.</p>

<h3>In the DRA submission tool, "BioSample Used" was moved</h3>

<p>In the DRA submission tool, "BioSample Used" was moved from rightmost to just right to "Experiment Alias",which enables users to easily understand relationship between "Experiment" and "referencing BioSample".</p>

<h3>Fastq from capillary sequencing platforms can be submitted to DRA</h3>

<p>In the DRA submission tool, capillary sequencing platforms can be selected.Fastq from these platforms can be submitted to DRA.To submit sequence chromatgrams, please continue to submit data to <a href="/dra/index-e.html">DDBJ Trace Archive</a>.</p>
