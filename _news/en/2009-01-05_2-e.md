<a href="http://arsa.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/top-e.html">ARSA</a> is a high-speed data retrieval system provided by DDBJ via WWW and Web API.<br>Because of the system trouble broken out on January 1, 2009 (unfortunately, it was during the new-year holidays), the ARSA service had been unavailable until today (Jan. 5 at 10:00). At present, the service is resumed. DDBJ apologize for your long-time inconvenience.
