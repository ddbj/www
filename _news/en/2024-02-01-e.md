### 1. Regarding the requirement to state the location and date of sample collection
As [previously mentioned](/activities/insdc_meeting/2022-e.html#2022-ft ), [INSDC](https://www.insdc.org/ ) discussed how to collect information, where and when the sample was collected, in the systematic way.    
DDBJ has already required the two attributes, [geo_loc_name](/biosample/attribute-e.html#geo_loc_name ) and [collection_date](/biosample/attribute-e.html#collection_date ), for [BioSample submission](/news/en/2023-05-17-e.html ).    
If it is difficult to describe the values for some reason, the submitter should indicate the reason as [missing values](https://www.insdc.org/submitting-standards/missing-value-reporting/ ).    
The requirement of [qualifiers](/ddbj/qualifiers-e.html) on [the flatfile](/ddbj/flat-file-e.html ) is planned to start from December 2024.    
The detailed schedule will be announced later.

* [Including Sample Location and Collection Date and Time for Sequences Submitted to GenBank and SRA](https://ncbiinsights.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2023/05/01/sequences-genbank-sra/ )

### 2. The /country qualifier will be renamed to /geo_loc_name from June 2024.
Due to the change, [DDBJ Nucleotide Sequence Submission System (NSSS)](/ddbj/web-submission.html ) will be suspended, to initialize the input contents of all submitters up to that point.    
The detailed schedule is announced [here](/news/en/2024-05-09-e.html ).
