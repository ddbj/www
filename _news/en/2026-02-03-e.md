Due to the expiration of the U.S. federal budget, we are unable to register new organism names or update organism names in the NCBI taxonomy database. Therefore, DDBJ will take the following actions for the time being.

* For new submissions of sequence data  
If you wish to submit sequences with new organism names, we will issue  accession numbers for sequences by replacing organism names with existing ones in the NCBI taxonomy database. We will update sequence data with new organism names after the NCBI taxonomy database is restarted.

* For update requests  
If you wish to submit sequences with new organism names, we will issue  accession numbers for sequences by replacing organism names with existing ones in the NCBI taxonomy database. We will update sequence data with new organism names after the NCBI taxonomy database is restarted.

Depending on the content of the request, we may ask you to postpone new entries or organism name updates until the NCBI taxonomy database is restarted.

The detail of organism names is [the page](/ddbj/organism-e.html).  

We apologize for the inconvenience and appreciate your understanding.
