<dd><a href="/E-mail/homology.html">DDBJ homology search services</a>(FASTA, BLAST, PSI-BLAST, SSEARCH) were updated on June 19th. The interfaces were changed and Blast server got faster than before.<br>
<dd>The default target division was changed from "all DNA data" to "all except EST, HTG, GSS, STS, SYN, UNA divisions".<br>It is also effective when "DDBJ ALL" or "DDBJ updates" is selected. By this change, you can search well-annotated DNA sequence data efficiently.</dd>
