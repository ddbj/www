The following events and troubles have been seen since the BioProject/BioSample/DRA/GEA/D-way services re-start in 29th September 2021.    
Please respond to some of these troubles as indicated. We are working to fix these troubles.

* When accessing to the file upload server "ftp-private.ddbj.nig.ac.jp", a warning regarding the host key change is displayed. → How to respond. FAQ: [Access to the ftp-private is blocked by the remote host key identification warning](/faq/en/known-hosts-e.html)    
* Links "Forgot username or password (English, Japanese)?" in the [D-way login page](https://ddbj.nig.ac.jp/D-way/login_form) do not work. → We will fix them. In the meantime, send your password change request from [Contact us](/contact-ddbj-e.html)
* [2021-10-06 resolved] A email address confirmation mail is not sent when creating a new D-way account. → Under investigation. Send your account creation request to [Contact us](/contact-ddbj-e.html) along with an account ID you want.   
* [2021-10-06 17:00 resolved] When executing scp command to ftp-private, "bash: scp: command not found" is shown. → Under investigation. This happens for newly created D-way accounts after the services re-start.
