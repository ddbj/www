<dd>GIB (Genome Information Broker)<br> provides an integrated search of Bacteria, Archaea, Eukaryota complete<br> genome sequences.<br> Because the genome sequence data of <i>Anaeromyxobacter dehalogenans<br> 2CP-C</i> (by Joint Genome Institute) and <i>Syntrophus aciditrophicus<br> SB</i> (by Integrated Genomics Inc.) were released, we incorporated them<br> to GIB, and now you can search those data.</dd>
