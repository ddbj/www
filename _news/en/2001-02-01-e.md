<dd>We started web home page of DDBJ in December 1994, and this web server include many services such as "Data Submission" and"Database Search and Analysis".<br>We renewed our home page in the end of January. The basic color is navy blue and headlines were divided into two. There are link buttons to major items in the left side. Key word search, site map, and jump button are also available in this new system. The URL is<br><a href="/">[http://www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/]. </a>(not changed) <small>["Other Databases moved to <a href="/infobio/links-e.html">"Links to information biology databases"</a>.]</small></dd>
