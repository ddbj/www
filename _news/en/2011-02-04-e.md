    <dd><a href="/ddbj/full_index-e.html">Feature Table Definition(FT-Doc)</a> is the common annotation manual among the three banks(DDBJ, EMBL-Bank, GenBank) for the construction of the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank International Nucleotide Sequence Database. Following the decision at an <a href="/activities/index-e.html">International Collaborators Meeting(ICM)</a> held annually in May, this FT-Doc is updated every year. In January 2011, FT-Doc is updated, based on <a href="/activities/index-e.html#2010">the 23rd International Collaborators Meeting</a>. </dd>
