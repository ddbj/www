<dd><b>Corresponding release</b><br> DDBJ release 63 (September 2005)
<dd><b>Relevant Accession numbers</b><br> See <a href="/files/pdf/051228-list.html">the list</a>
<dd><b>Measures:</b><br> These 37 entries are correctly included in the PRI division of DDBJ<br> release 64 (December 2005)<br> On the getentry and anonymous FTP, the corrected entries have already<br> been available.
<dd><b>Affected DDBJ services and period:</b><br> All services including the following services<br> - getentry (eearly October, 2005 - 2005/12/28)<br> - Anonymous FTP (2005/9/30 - 2005/12/28)<br> - SRS, ARSA, Homology Search services (early October, 2005 - mid-January,<br> 2006 *)<br> *Please note that some services will be affected by this trouble even<br> after release 64 is released, for a short time.<br> We apologize for our mistake very much.</dd>
