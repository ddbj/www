<p>Due to over-load of the servers, submission and search systems are unstable. Accession number assignment to submitted data has been delayed. To reduce the load, the DRASearch indexing was stopped. The getentry indexing of new records will be delayed. Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause.</p>
