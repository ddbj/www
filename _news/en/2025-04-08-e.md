### Regarding the Change in Data File Upload Method
The method for uploading DRA/GEA/DDBJ/MetaboBank data to the DDBJ Center's file reception server (ftp-private.ddbj.nig.ac.jp) has been changed from scp to sftp.
For instructions on how to upload via sftp, please refer to [Data upload](../../upload-e.html).
