<dd>GIB (Genome Information Broker)<br> provides an integrated search of Bacteria, Archaea, Eukaryota complete<br> genome sequences.
<dd>Because the genome sequence data of <i>Nitrobacter hamburgensis X14</i> and<br> <i>Chromohalobacter salexigens DSM 3043</i> were released by Joint Genome<br> Institute, we incorporated them to GIB, and now you can search those data.</dd>
