<dd>We updated our <a href="/index-e.html">home page</a> on October 5, 2007, to make our data submitters and users comfortable at the DDBJ site.<br>
<dd>The key points of the updating are as follows:<br>

    <ul>
        <li>Redesign of our site navigation system.<br><br>Based on a current trend of web site design,

            <ul class="list02">
                <li>we have placed <b>a global menu near the top of the page</b>, and</li>
                <li><b>local (context-sensitive) menus at the left- hand side</b> of each page.<br> Furthermore, </li>
                <li><b>the bread-crumb trail</b> is located under the<br>left corner of the global menu to help you avoid losing your way in<br>our web site.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>In the new HP when you click one of the global menus, you can observe all the contents of each service at a glance, and make the best choice without stress.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Creation of a window for searching databases at the top of each page:<br><br>In the new HP, you can <b>search following types of data from the search<br>window of each page</b>, without migrating to the main page of the<br>databases here and there.</li>
    </ul>

    <p></p>
