New application form for Mass Submission System (MSS), [https://mss.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/](https://mss.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/), has been open since June 15, 2022. The submitters can apply for MSS and also upload the submission files through the new form (SFTP file transferring is available if you cannot upload the files through the Web because of many number of files and/or huge file size).

[D-way account](https://www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/account-e.html) is required to use the new MSS form. If you have not obtained yet, [create your own account from here](https://ddbj.nig.ac.jp/D-way/contents/general/reserve_account_page), and login to [https://mss.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/](https://mss.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/).
