<dd>Sequences of Mus musculus cDNA (full-length, with annotation on their function) have been submitted to DDBJ by Dr. Y. Hayashizaki (Project Director)'s team at the RIKEN (Institute of Physical and Chemical Research) Genomic Sciences Center. We assigned accession numbers AK002213-AK018700 (16,454 entries), AK018701-AK021412 (2,712 entries) , AK027261-AK027262 (2 entries) to these sequences, and released them in the HTC division of the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank International Nucleotide Sequence Database.The sequences were also published in Nature 409, 685-690 (8/2/2001).</dd>
