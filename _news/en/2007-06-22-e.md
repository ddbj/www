<dd><a href="http://getentry.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/top-e.html">getentry</a> is the data retrieval system provided by DDBJ through web and E-mail.
<dd>Recently, we found there were some entries, which had not been displayed at the getentry for a certain period. Details are as follows;

    <ul>
        <li><b>Affected periods:</b> February 27, 2007 - June 20, 2007</li>
        <li><b>Undisplayable entries:</b>(<a href="/wp-content/uploads/wgs_mikoukai_070621e.pdf">--&gt;see the accession numbers list</a>)</li>
        <li><b>Note:</b>Anonymous FTPs (WGS data and Organism List) were not affected by this trouble. Users have been able to download the correct datasets.<br></li>
    </ul>
<dd>The undisplayed data had been modified at the getentry maintenance works executed on June 19, 2007, and currently, all the data can be displayed.
<dd>We deeply apologize for any inconveniences that this may have caused to our users.<br>We will try to set the preventive measures to cope with these troubles immediately.</dd>
