[DRASearch](https://ddbj.nig.ac.jp/DRASearch/) indexing has been delayed and DRA records released after 16th June 2021 have not been indexed yet. 
It will take about two weeks to finish indexing. We apologize for any inconvenience.  
Public DRA data are indexed by [NCBI SRA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra) without delays.

The delay was resolved. Now [DRASearch](https://ddbj.nig.ac.jp/DRASearch/) indexes metadata released two days ago.
