<dd>According to the NIG computer system replacement conducted in this February, DDBJ switched the "Search &amp; Analysis" service system to the present new system.<br>After switching, the old search system terminated receiving the requests, and stopped its operation as of March 9, 2007 at 17:00.
<dd>Because the requests which had been received by the old system (FASTA, BLAST, PSI-BLAST, SSEARCH, ClustalW) could not be transferred to the current system, all the requests which had not been completed their execution by the termination of the old system was cancelled.
