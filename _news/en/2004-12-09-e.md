<dd>GIB (Genome Information Broker) provides an integrated search of Bacteria, Archaea, Eukaryota complete genome sequences. Because the genome sequence data of <i>Azoarcus sp. EbN1</i> and <i>Idiomarina loihiensis L2TR</i> were released by Max Planck Institute and University of Hawaii, we incorporated them to GIB, and now you can search those data.
