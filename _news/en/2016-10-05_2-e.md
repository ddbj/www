<p>In BLAST, when showing a search results to web browser, we found a bug as follows.</p>

<p><span class="icon_square"> Period: From new BLAST system released on April 2013</span><br><span class="icon_square"> Extent of the impact: BLAST</span> (<span class="font-red font-bold">*</span>There is no problem with WABI BLAST.)<br><span class="icon_square"> Situation: If "PRE" included in BLAST search results, this character was replaced "DIV"</span></p>

<p>This problem has already been fixed and the service works normally.</p>

<p>We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience you have been caused by this trouble.</p>
