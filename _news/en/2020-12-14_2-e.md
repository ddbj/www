A new annotation template for SARS-CoV-2 genome is now available in [NSSS](/ddbj/websub-e.html).    
It reduces an effort to input the annotation data and shortens a time to complete the submission.    
You can use the template by selecting "Virus", followed by "SARS-CoV-2, complete or nearly complete genome" at "Template" page.    
We would like to ask you to register SARS-CoV-2 genome.
