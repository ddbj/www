<dd>GIB (Genome Information Broker) provides an integrated search of Bacteria, Archaea, Eukaryota complete genome sequences.
<dd>Because the genome sequence data of <i>Haloquadratum walsbyi DSM 16790</i> (by Max-Planck-Institute), <i>Roseobacter denitrificans OCh 114</i> (by JTranslational Genomics Research Institute) were released, we incorporated them to GIB, and now you can search those data.</dd>
