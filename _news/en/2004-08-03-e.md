<dd><a href="/services/past-services-e.html#gib">GIB (Genome Information Broker)</a> provides an integrated search of Bacteria, Archaea, Eukaryota complete genome sequences. Because the genome sequence data of <i>Propionibacterium acnes KPA171202</i> was released by Goettingen Genomics Laboratory, we incorporated it to GIB, and now you can search those data.</dd>
