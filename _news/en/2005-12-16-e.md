<dd>GIB (Genome Information Broker) provides an integrated search of Bacteria, Archaea, Eukaryota complete genome sequences. Because the genome sequence data of <i>Rhodospirillum rubrum ATCC 11170</i>,<i>Moorella thermoacetica ATCC 39073</i> (by JGI) and <i>Hahella chejuensis KCTC 2396</i> (by Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology) were released, we incorporated them to GIB, and now you can search those data.</dd>
