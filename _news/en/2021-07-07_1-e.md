## Announcement
**The delay of loading bulk sequence data was solved**    
We fixed the delay of loading bulk sequence data from GenBank reported in the     
previous periodical release.  We regret any inconvenience it may cause and     
appreciate your understanding.    

**DDBJ will postpone the next periodical release 125 to December 2021**    
Since DDBJ is planning to improve its systems substantially during the third     
quarter of 2021, DDBJ will skip making up the next periodical release in     
September 2021.  So, DDBJ periodical release 125 will be provided in December     
2021.
