<dd>Duplication of the AE006470 was found in the DDBJ release 62.0 (released on June 2005).
<dd>Nature of inconsistency: The entry AE006470 was found in both BCT and CON divisions.
<dd>Measures implemented: The AE006470 in the BCT division is the latest one, so we removed the old AE006470 in the CON division and released again on August 4, 2005.
<dd>Corrected file: ddbjcon.seq
<dd>We DDBJ regret our mistake.
