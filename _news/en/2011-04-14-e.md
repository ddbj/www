Days from April 29 to May 8, 2011 are national holidays called Golden Week in Japan. We will at DDBJ suspend our work for releasing data and answering all inquiries during consecutive holidays. Search and analysis and other WWW services are available. We will go back to work as usual from May 9.Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.
