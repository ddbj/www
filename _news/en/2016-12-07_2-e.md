      <h3>Limited-time access to archived fastq/SRA files</h3>

      <p><a href="/dra/services/index.html#Limited-time_access_to_archived_fastq/SRA_files">DRA Handbook</a></p>

      <p>To allow submitter to download and check archived fastq/SRA files, the files are copied to the following directories on the dradata.ddbj.nig.ac.jp server from 12th, Jan. 2017. To save disk space, the copied files are automatically deleted in one month.</p>

      <p class="attention">Due to unexpected decrease of available disk space, copied fastq/SRA files may be deleted within one month or the copy service may be suspended. We will inform submitters on the website in advance as much as possible, however, this annoucement could be immediately before the deletion or service suspension.</p>
