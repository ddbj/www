[DRASearch](https://ddbj.nig.ac.jp/DRASearch/) indexing has been delayed and DRA records released after 5th September 2021 have not been indexed yet. It will be around 21th October to finish indexing.  
[NCBI SRA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra) indexes DRA records released after 28th September.   
[EBI](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/) fully mirrors DRA records released after 12th September, and indexes submission and sample metadata of those released during 13th Septermber-12th October.   

The DRA public metadata, fastq and sra files have been distributed without delay at [DRA ftp](https://ddbj.nig.ac.jp/public/ddbj_database/dra/fastq/).

We apologize for any inconvenience.
