<dd>Inconsistency was found in some entries of the latest DDBJ Release 58 (released on June 30, 2004).<br>
<dd><b>Nature of inconsistency:</b><br> Description of "BASE COUNT" line was not included in some data.<br>
<dd><b>Measures implemented:</b><br> Defected data were corrected, and released again on July 9.<br>
<dd><b><a href="/files/pdf/040709.html">List of corrected files:</a></b><br>
<dd>We DDBJ regret our mistake.<br>
<dd>
    <pre><code>[Note on "BASE COUNT" line]<br>  Although GenBank had dropped the BASE COUNT line from their flat file format from GenBank Release 138 (Oct. 2003), we DDBJ still keep the BASE COUNT line in DDBJ flat file format, because we believe that this information is useful, such as computing the GC contents.</code></pre>
