<dd>SwissProt has been reorganized as UniProt as of January 1, 2005. Accordingly, the names of their ftp sites have been changed. Without knowing the change we at DDBJ carried out ftp to obtain the UniProt regular and updated releases last month. We are thus afraid that those who retrieved the UniProt data though DDBJ in the period from February 2nd to 25th obtained unsatisfactory results. We apologize for this very much.We are now serving the correct sets of the regular and updated releases of the UniProt data.</dd>
