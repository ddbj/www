<dd>The features of ARSA are as follows:<br>

    <ul><br>
        <li><br>ARSA provides one-stop query to 23 life science databases including DDBJ International Nucleotide Sequence Database.

            <p></p>
        </li>
        <li>ARSA will return a quick response to any query regardless of the complexity of the query, the number of hits to the query and the target database(s)

            <p></p>
        </li>
        <li>In the case of DDBJ, you can define search conditions in details by use of any combination of <a href="/ddbj/flat-file-e.html">Features/Qualifiers</a> of the DDBJ flat file.

        </li>
