<dd>SAKURA (DDBJ DNA Data submission system) service will be stopped during the following period because of the upgrade of SAKURA.<br><b>Apr.29 (Sat) - May 7 (Sun)</b><br>
<dd>
    <font color="#FF0000">The upgraded service of SAKURA will start after the period.</font><br>The new SAKURA system accepts almost all features/qualifiers that DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank provide. In addition it checks input data more strictly, which makes you find an error in your input data more easily.<br>As a result of many changes in the new system, the data format of the new system is not compatible with that of the current system.<br>If you are planning to do sequential submission, please complete it before the current system is stopped, or start the registration after the new SAKURA is released.<br>We appreciate your cooperation.
