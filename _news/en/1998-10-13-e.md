<dd><a href="http://gdbwww.gdb.org/">The Genome Database project (GDB)</a>,which provides human gene mapping data to human genetics researchers from its base at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, has ceased its operations.<br>This action is a consequence of the decision by the project's primary funder, the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Energy Research, to discontinue GDB funding in order to focus its informatics resources primarily on the results of the sequencing phase of the Human Genome Project.<br>
<dd>The database will continue to be made available to the scientific community till January 31, 1999.The extension is to provide a smooth transition of the database to <a href="http://compbio.ornl.gov">the Computational Biosciences at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL)</a>.</dd>
