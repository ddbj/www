From July to mid-August, some of the newly published data of JGA could not be searched by DDBJ search.  
In addition, there was a problem that public data registered in Europe and United States could not be  
searched by DDBJ search, but it has been resolved now. I'm sorry to have troubled you for so long.

If any defects remain, please let us know from the [contact form](https://www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/contact-ddbj-e.html).  
Thank you for your continued support of DDBJ.

Masanori Arita, Director of Bioinformation and DDBJ Center
