<dd>"getentry" is the entry retrieval system by accession numbers etc,<br>which is provided by DDBJ via <a href="http://getentry.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/top-e.html">WWW</a> and E-mail servers.
<dd>Recently, we found there were some entries which had not been displayed on the web version of getentry for a certain period (see below for details).
<dd>We kindly request users to conduct their searchesagain if you have used the web version of getentry in the affected period. Currently, the web version of getentry works normally.
<dd>Fortunately, the e-mail version of getentry was not affected by this trouble.
<dd>Details are as follows:

    <table border="0">
        <tr>
            <td> </td>
            <th valign="top" align="left" nowrap>Period:</th>
            <td valign="top" colspan="2">Dec. 5, 15:00 - Dec. 6, 14:00</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th> </th>
            <th valign="top" align="left" nowrap>Cause:</th>
            <td valign="top" colspan="2">bug at the web version program for the display of the results</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th> </th>
            <th valign="top" align="left" nowrap>Condition:</th>
            <td valign="top" colspan="2">Users could not view the results under the following conditions.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th> </th>
            <th valign="top" nowrap> </th>
            <td valign="top"> </td>
            <td valign="top"> - when you specify:<br> ID as [Accession],<br> DATABASE as [Flat File (DDBJ)],<br> Result as [WWW] and<br> enter the accession numbers which start from C, CZ, or X </td>
        </tr>
    </table>
