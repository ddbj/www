<p>We have released the new DRA submission system. For major changes, please see the <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/DDBJslide/new-dra-submission-system-starts">slides</a> and <a href="/dra/services/index.html">new handbook</a>.</p>(6th, June, 2014)

<p><span class="attention_text">For submissions with status "new" which had been created before 12th, May, 2014, addition or deletion of metadata objects could cause errors. It is recommended that download metadata as a tab-delimited text file and upload it into a newly created submission.</span></p>
