<span class="red">[2026-02-09] </span>    
We have resumed mirroring the NCBI/EBI SRA data.    
We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused.

Due to a shortage of storage capacity, the DDBJ Center has suspended the mirroring of sra files from NCBI/EBI SRA as of March 2025.  

Current Status:  
* From March 2025 onwards: Mirroring of NCBI/EBI SRA files has been suspended.
* From October 2023 to February 2025: Only a portion of the publicly available SRA files has been mirrored.
* Metadata: Mirroring continues for all periods, and metadata remains searchable in DDBJ Search.

As a result, some data found in [DDBJ Search](https://ddbj.nig.ac.jp/search) may not be available for download as sra files via HTTPS or FTP. For data that has not been mirrored, we kindly ask users to download it directly from NCBI or EBI.

* NCBI SRA: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra)
* EBI SRA: [https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/search](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/search)

We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience caused to our users and for the delay in providing this information. We will provide updates on future plans through our news as soon as they are determined.
