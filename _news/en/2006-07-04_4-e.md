<dd><a href="http://srs.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/top-j.html">SRS (Sequence Retrieval System) </a> is the keyword retrieval service provided by DDBJ WWW server. After the incorporation of DDBJ release 66 data into SRS database, EST and GSS divisions data will be removed from SRS DDBJRELEASE and DDBJNEW database.
<dd>Because of the time lag between DDBJ release date (66 was released on June 29) and its loading time to SRS database, this change will be practically refleted to the service around mid to the end of July.
<dd>Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.</dd>
