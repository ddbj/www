<a href="http://gib-v.genes.nig.ac.jp/" target="new">Genome Information Broker for Viruses (GIB-V)</a> extracted 52,088 complete virus genomes or segments data from DDBJ release 78 and enhanced host information. The host information which is not written in DDBJ entry is added by using cross reference information of <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/uniprot/" target="new">UNIPROT</a> entry. Furthermore, a common name is converted to a scientific name by using <a href="http://txsearch.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/top-e.html" target="new">TxSearch</a> system.
