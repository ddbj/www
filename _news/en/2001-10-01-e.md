<dd>We enhanced <a href="/services/past-services-e.html#gib">GIB</a> to version 3.0 to accommodate rapidly increasing genomic information. GIB 3.0 uses distributed RDBs on multiple PC-Linux platforms and a homology search server on Unix platform. The WWW server communicates with these servers by use of<br>CORBA and XML. The new version of GIB stores, processes and displays all the features in the Flat Files including CDS and RNA. In a comparative genomes page of GIB 3.0, you can select multiple genomes that you are interested in. The user interface is improved in GIB 3.0 as well.</dd>
