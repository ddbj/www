<dd>The system failures in DDBJ's homology search services were recovered<br> on February 27 at 15:30. At present, the correct results are available.
<dd>Thank you very much for your understanding and cooperation.
<dd>

    <ul>
        <li>Period : February 19, 2006 - February 27, 2006 15:30</li>
        <li>Affected services :all homology search programs (WWW, E-mail) except<br> for PSI-BLAST* </li>
    </ul>
<dd>*Please note that S&amp;W SEARCH takes a littel more time for the recovery<br> because the incorporation of the corrected database into S&amp;W SEARCH<br> program requires more longer times than other services.
<dd><b>S&amp;W SEARCH was resumed. At present, all<br> services work normally (02:15, Mar 1).</b></dd>
