There are disabilities in the [DDBJ Search](https://ddbj.nig.ac.jp/search) keyword search functionalities.

* DRA (sra-submission, sra-experiment, sra-run): keyword search works for accession numbers and keywords.
* JGA (jga-study): keyword search works for accession numbers and keywords.
* BioProject (bioproject): keyword search DOES NOT work for accession numbers and keywords.   
If an accession number is known, please directly access URL in the form of https://ddbj.nig.ac.jp/resource/bioproject/[bioproject_accession].     
Example, [https://ddbj.nig.ac.jp/resource/bioproject/PRJDB12105](https://ddbj.nig.ac.jp/resource/bioproject/PRJDB12105)    
You may also search at [NCBI BioProject](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject) and [EBI](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/).
* BioSample (biosample): keyword search DOES NOT work for accession numbers and keywords.    
If an accession number is known, please directly access URL in the form of https://ddbj.nig.ac.jp/resource/biosample/[biosample_accession].    
Example, [https://ddbj.nig.ac.jp/resource/biosample/SAMD00394581](https://ddbj.nig.ac.jp/resource/biosample/SAMD00394581)    
You may also search at [NCBI BioSample](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/biosample) and [EBI BioSample](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biosamples/).

We apologize for the inconvenience caused by this.
