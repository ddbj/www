[DRASearch](https://ddbj.nig.ac.jp/DRASearch/) indexing has been delayed and DRA records released after 5th September 2021 have not been indexed yet.    
[NCBI SRA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra) indexes DRA records released after 28th September.   
[EBI](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/) fully mirrors DRA records released after 31th October, and indexes submission and sample metadata of those released during 13th Septermber-22th October.   

The DRA public metadata, fastq and sra files have been distributed without delay at [DRA ftp](https://ddbj.nig.ac.jp/public/ddbj_database/dra/fastq/).

Please refer to the FAQ [I cannot find my DRA accession number in DRASearch. What should I do?](/faq/en/dra-accession-not-found-e.html)

We apologize for any inconvenience.
