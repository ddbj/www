<span class="red">18th November, 2021: DRA Search is closed.</span>

8th November, 2021: public DRA data distributed after 5th November, 2021 are searchable.

[DRASearch](https://ddbj.nig.ac.jp/DRASearch/) indexing has been delayed and DRA records released after 5th September 2021 have not been indexed yet.    
[NCBI SRA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra) indexes DRA records released after 28th September.   
[EBI](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/) fully mirrors DRA records released after 31th October, and indexes submission and sample metadata of those released during 13th Septermber-22th October.   

The DRA public metadata, fastq and sra files have been distributed without delay at [DRA ftp](https://ddbj.nig.ac.jp/public/ddbj_database/dra/fastq/).
