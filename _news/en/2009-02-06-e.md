In the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank International Nucleotide Sequence Database, owing to some accident, a part of EMBL originated entries were overwritten by the old data, and were incorporated into the search target database for getentry and ARSA. <br>Therefore, since February 5 (Thu) early morning (JST), the entries of the listed accession numbers (<a href="2009/acclist090206.txt">see the list</a>) are not displayed at the latest version (other than listed entries are correctly displayed).<br> <br>At present, DDBJ hastens to the recovery works of the latest version data (the works are scheduled to finish within February 6. Completion of the works will be notified in this DDBJ HP.)<br>If you did a search of the DDBJ database using getentry and/or ARSA after February 5 (Thu) early morning (JST), please execute your search again after the completion of the data recovery.

<p>We awfully apologize for your inconvenience.</p>
