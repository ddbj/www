<dd>GIB (Genome Information Broker) provides an integrated search of Bacteria, Archaea, Eukaryota complete genome sequences. Because the genome sequence data of <i>Ehrlichia ruminantium Welgevonden</i> was released by University of Pretoria, we incorporated it to GIB, and now you can search those data.
<dd><small>Reference: The genome of the heartwater agent, Ehrlichia ruminantium, contains multiple tandem repeats of actively variable copy number, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 102, 838-843(2005).</small></dd>
