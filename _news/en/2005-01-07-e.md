<dd>GIB (Genome Information Broker) provides an integrated search of Bacteria, Archaea, Eukaryota complete genome sequences. Because the genome sequence data of <i>Ehrlichia ruminantium Welgevonden</i> was released by University of Pretoria, we incorporated it to GIB, and now you can search those data.
