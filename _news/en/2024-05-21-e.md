The National Institute of Genetics at the Research Organization of Information and Systems (ROIS-NIG) and other Founding Members of the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC) have enhanced its website, [www.insdc.org](https://www.insdc.org/), to provide comprehensive information on how interested parties from around the world can participate in the INSDC. This effort supports INSDC’s aim to broaden membership and attract qualified nucleotide sequence databases. The INSDC website now provides a formalized Founders Arrangement and a Membership Arrangement, along with other updated information about the INSDC mission, vision, governance, and technical documentation. INSDC encourages interested parties to visit the INSDC website to learn more.
