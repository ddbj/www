There is currently an issue with the DDBJ Search system where newly released or re-released DRA records cannot be searched. Additionally, the process for importing newly released SRA data from NCBI/EBI has been halted. We are actively working to resolve these issues. We apologize for the inconvenience and appreciate your understanding.

Please note that newly released or re-released DDBJ BioProjects and BioSamples are being imported without any problems.

Mirroring of newly released or re-released DRAs to the NCBI SRA is functioning normally. Until the issues with DDBJ Search are resolved, please use the [NCBI SRA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra) as an alternative.
