<p>After submitting BioSamples from D-way, BioSamples are sorted in alphabetical (ASCII code) order of sample_name values and NOT in order of appearance (top to bottom in tab-delimited text file). BioSample accession numbers are issued to the alphabetically-sorted BioSamples.</p>

<p>Please enter sample_name values as such their "order of appearance" and "alphabetical order" to be same.</p>

<p>Since the sample_name is used as the identifier in database system, it cannot be changed after submission. Submitters can name sample by using the sample_title attribute. The sample_title is used as a title in public record and can be updated.</p>

<p class="bold">sample_names contain serial numbers</p>

<p class="no_bottom">Following samples are sorted as intended.</p>0001_control<br>0002_a sample<br>0003_b sample<br><br>

<p class="no_bottom">Following examples are NOT sorted as intended (sorted by first letters).</p>1_control<br>5_a sample<br>10_b sample<br>-&gt;<br>1_control<br>10_b sample<br>5_a sample<br><br>

<p>DDBJ is developing the database system to preserve order of appearance (top to bottom in tab-delimited text file). If you have questions, please contact us from <a href="/contact-e.html?db=biosample">here</a>.</p>
