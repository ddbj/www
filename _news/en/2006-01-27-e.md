<dd>GIB (Genome Information Broker)<br> provides an integrated search of Bacteria, Archaea, Eukaryota complete<br> genome sequences.<br> Because the genome sequence data of <i>Erythrobacter litoralis HTCC2594</i><br> was released by J. Craig Venter Institute, we incorporated it to GIB,<br> and now you can search those data.</dd>
