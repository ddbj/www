<dd>Cynomolgus monkeys (<i>Macaca fascicularis</i>) are common laboratory animals widely used for medical and pharmaceutical researches. Macaca fascicularis cDNA database (QFbase) was constructed by JCRB Genebank, National Institute of Biomedical Innovation, Japan, under collaborative research with Laboratory for DNA Data Analysis, CIB-DDBJ, National Institute of Genetics, Japan;<br> Division of Genetic Diagnosis, <a href="http://www.ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp/imswww/index-e.html">Institite of Medical Sciences</a> and Department of Medical Genome Sciences, University of Tokyo, Japan.
<dd>The database provides about 85,000 5' or 3' EST sequences of cynomolgus monkey cDNA libraries derived from the brain, liver, and testis. About 4,000 full-length cDNA sequences are also included in the database and 1,700 of them contain the information for human-macaque difference in the protein coding region.
<dd>Accession numbers released from DDBJ are BB873801 - BB894695 (20895 entries, 3'EST) and CJ430287 - CJ493524 (63238 entries, 5'EST). These entries can be retrievable via DDBJ <a href="http://getentry.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/top-e.html">getentry</a> system.
<dd>The cDNA clones are ready to be provided though <a href="http://www.jhsf.or.jp/English/index_e.html">Human Science Research Resource Bank (HSRRB)</a> for further functinal experiments.
<dd>All data are available at http://genebank.nibio.go.jp/gbank/index_e.html.
<dd>This "QFbase" is also intorduced atLink to DDBJ/CIB web pages on Information Biology and Link to Other web pages on Information Biology: Databases for Other Mammals pages. For your reference, please see these pages, too.</dd>
