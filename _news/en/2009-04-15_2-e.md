<html><a href="http://getentry.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/top-e.html" target="_blank">getentry</a> is the entry retrieval system by accession numbers etc., which is provided by DDBJ via WWW and WebAPI.<br>In the getentry, during the following period, some incorrect Korean Patent entries were included. Details are as follows.<dd>

    <ul>
        <li><b>Database</b>: "Patnet" in the Protein DATABASE</li>
        <li><b>Accession Nos</b>:4,541 entries of DI500718 - DI613550 (<a href="/files/pdf/koreanpatent090414.pdf">see the list</a>)</li>
        <li><b>Period</b>: March 31 - April 8, 2009.</li>
        <li><b>Cause</b>: In the modification process of the previously released entries, wrong accession numbers were assigned to the corresponding patent numbers. As a result, the relation between the patent number and the accession numbers was not correct.</li>
        <li><b>Measure</b>: Any relevant data were already deleted, and will be re-released after the completion of the correction.<br>
            <font color="#ff0000">The problem has been fixed. ( May. 1, 2009 ) </font>
