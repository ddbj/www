<p>Previously, the number of files on the directory for <a href="/ddbj/wgs-e.html">WGS data</a> (ftp.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/ddbj_database/wgs/) was too huge and it was difficult to access the directory, so, we divided the files into sub-directories.<br>We are very sorry for such an urgent announcement. We changed the FTP site for WGS data as follows.<br>We apologize for the inconveniences and thank you for your understanding and cooperation on this modification.</p>

<p>Date: January 25th, 2018</p>

<p>Before: All WGS data in the files named as the <a href="/ddbj/documents/prefix-e.html ">prefixes</a> of their <a href="/ddbj/flat-file-e.html#Accession">accession numbers</a> as follows were placed with under the following directory;</p>
<pre><code>ftp.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/ddbj_database/wgs/****.gz</code></pre>

<p class="top_space">After: They have been divided into following sub-directories named after <span class="red bold">the first two letters of the prefixes</span> of their accession numbers;</p>
<pre><code>ftp.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/ddbj_database/wgs/AA/AA**.gz
ftp.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/ddbj_database/wgs/AB/AB**.gz
:
ftp.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/ddbj_database/wgs/AZ/AZ**.gz

ftp.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/ddbj_database/wgs/BB/BB**.gz
:

<p class="top_space">Please note that the files for file list of WGS data (WGS_ORGANISM_LIST.html and WGS_ORGANISM_LIST.txt) are remained at ftp.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/ddbj_database/wgs/.</p>
