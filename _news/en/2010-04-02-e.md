    <dd>The Result Retrieiver is a tool for the confirmation of <a href="/services-e.html">DDBJ's homology search</a> results when you specify "E-mail" as a method for getting the results. In this Result Retriever, a trouble had broken out during the following period. Details are as follows:

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Period:</strong> April 1, 2010 at 9:30 - April 2, 2010 at 12:00 (JST)</li>
            <li><strong>Situation:</strong> The results had not been displayed in the Result Retriever during the above period.</li>
            <li><strong>Cause:</strong> An effect by the works for the termination of some homology search services.</li>
