<dd><a href="/services/past-services-e.html#gib">GIB (Genome Information Broker)</a> provides an integrated search of Bacteria, Archaea, Eukaryota complete genome sequences.Because the following two genome sequence data were released, we incorporated it to GIB, and now you can search those data.<br>
<dd><small><i>Erwinia carotovora subsp. atroseptica SCRI1043</i> (Sanger Institute): <br>The genome sequence of the enterobacterial phytopathogen Erwinia carotovora subsp. atroseptica SCRI1043 and functional genomic identification of novel virulence factors, Unpublished.</small><br>
<dd><small><i>Acinetobacter sp. ADP1</i> (Genoscope): <br> Unique features revealed by the genome sequence of Acinetobacter sp. ADP1, a versatile and naturally transformation competent bacterium, Unpublished.</small></dd>
