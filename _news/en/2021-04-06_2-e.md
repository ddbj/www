For now, we have stopped issuing accession numbers and releasing nucleotide sequence data because of the database troubles in NSSS and MSS. We will be able to issue the accession numbers and release data after the system recovers. We would appreciate your understanding and patience.

2021-04-07 The system has been recovered.
