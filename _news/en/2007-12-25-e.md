<dd>The nucleotide sequence database collected and maintained by DDBJ is quarterly released online to the public. We completed DDBJ Release 72 in December 25, 2007. DDBJ Release 72 consists of 79,004,098 entries, and the number of bases reached 82,592,245,487.
<dd>The periodical release and the new data are available by FTP download from the <a href="/services/index-e.html "> "FTP/Web API" page</a>.
<dd>As was already notified, DDBJ proceeded deletion of the both phone and fax numbers, and E-mail address from the flat files of the entries submitted to DDBJ. The retrofit of the all entries was completed by the issue of this release 72. Hereafter, database users become difficult to contact submitters based on the information described in the DDBJ flat files. When you wish to contact to the submitter(s) of an entry of your interest, please contact us using the prescribed inquiry form placed in the DDBJ HP.
