<dd>DDBJ provides ClustalW services through<a href="%C2%A1%C3%89http://clustalw.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/top-e.html%C2%A1%C3%89"> WWW</a> and <a href="%C2%A1%C3%89/search/explain/clustalw_exp-e.html%C2%A1%C3%89">E-mail</a>. In the ClustalW results received by E-mails, incorrect results may have been returneed. Details are as follows:
<dd>

    <ul><br>
        <li><b>Service:</b>ClustalW<br></li>
        <li><b>Period:</b>from 14:00 on August 27, 2007 to 18:00 on September 7, 2007<br></li>
        <li><b>Condition:</b>When you selected "E-mail" to obtain the results and specified "AUTOMATIC" in the TYPE option (In the WWW, the default was selected. And in the E-mail server, "is_align 1" was specified without specifying DNA/PROTEIN in the type option), incorrect results might have been returned.<br></li>
        <li><b>Cause:</b>system error<br></li>
        <li><b>Results:</b>In the above cases, incorrect results might have been returned. Therefore, if you did the ClustalW analysis in the corresponding conditions during the above period, we are sorry but we ask you to do the analysis again in the same conditions to get the correct results (The program error had already been fixed, and now, the correct results can be obtained).<br></li>
    </ul>
<dd>We deeply apologize for any inconveniences that this may have caused to our users.</dd>
