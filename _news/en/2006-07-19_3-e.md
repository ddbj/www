<dd>GIB (Genome Information Broker) provides an integrated search of Bacteria, Archaea, Eukaryota complete genome sequences.
<dd>Because the genome sequence data of <i>Francisella tularensis subsp. tularensis FSC 198</i> (by University of Birmingham), <i>Cytophaga hutchinsonii ATCC 33406</i> and <i>Mesorhizobium sp. BNC1</i> (by Joint Genome Institute) were released, we incorporated them to GIB, and now you can search those data.</dd>
