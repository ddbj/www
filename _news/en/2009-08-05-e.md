DDBJ Trace Archive (DTA) is an archive for DNA sequence chromatograms (traces), base calls, and quality estimates for single-pass reads from capillary sequencers. The DRA and DTA collect the data in a collaboration with <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/" target="new">NCBI</a> and <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/" target="new">EBI</a>.<br><br>This DRA/DTA website describes the instructions for the data submission, file transfer, etc. This website will be helpful for the submission of the data from next-generation and/or capillary sequencers. Please refer them when you submit such data.<br><br>Moreover, in the DTA site, the data search (submitted via DDBJ) is available.

<p>The DRA and DTA are a part of <a href="http://dbcls.rois.ac.jp/en/" target="_new">National project of integrating life science databases</a>.</p>
