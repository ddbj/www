<dd>DDBJ is now developing a new data management system to cope more efficiently with a large amount of incoming data. The new data management system is expected to be in operation from April 1st, 2001.<br>Since the new system no longer accommodates data presented in 'Authorin' or 'Submission Form', DDBJ will stop accepting data in those two forms from April 1st, 2001.<br>
<dd>Please use the WWW submission tool, SAKURA instead of the two forms.<br>
<dd>Thank you very much for your understanding and cooperation.</dd>
