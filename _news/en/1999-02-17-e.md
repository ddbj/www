<dd>GenBank has been phasing out use of Authorin as a data submission tool. We DDBJ still accept Authorin submissions. However, we terminated distribution, because Authorin is not compatible with Macintosh 32bit<br>addressing nor Windows.<br>
<dd>We DDBJ recommend you to use <a href="http://sakura.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/" target="_blank">SAKURA </a>on the Web or <a href="/sequin/index.html">sequin ver. 2.6</a>,a stand-alone program for PC, Macintosh, and Unix platforms.</dd>
