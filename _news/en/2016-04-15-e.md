<p>To submit data to DRA, a public key needs to be registered to the D-way account (<a href="/account-e.html#Enable_DRA_submission_in_account">Handbook</a>)。At present, a public key in OpenSSH format commonly used in Mac OS X and Unix, is not properly registered to the account. We apologize for the inconvenience caused.</p>

<p>This issue will be resolved at 25th, April.</p>

<p>If submitter wants to <span class="bold">newly</span> use OpenSSH keys, please follow the steps below.</p>

<p>1. Register a public key: Please generate key pairs by PuTTY Key Generator, and register the public key in PuTTY format to your account. <a href="/account-e.html#Enable_DRA_submission_in_account">Handbook (Windows)</a></p>Upload data files to the DRA server by 2 or 3.

<p>2. Upload files in scp by using WinSCP in Windows machine. <a href="/dra/services/index.html#Upload_sequence_data">Handbook (Windows)</a></p>

<p>3.
