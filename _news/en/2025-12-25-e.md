#### Dec. 25 WGS entries released from ENA during the following period have not appeared in getentry and DDBJ ftp.

The affected entries are as follows:
- WGS entries from ENA distributed on and after November 25, 2025.

Reason
- ENA has released a rapidly increasing number of WGS entries, and DDBJ distribution system cannot keep up.
    - Number of released files from ENA    
    Nov. 23 - Nov. 27 approx. 70,000 files    
    Dec. 7 approx. 530,000 files    
    Dec. 24 approx. 400,000 files    

How solving the problem
- Maximizing the number of daily distributions within DDBJ's processing capacity. We expect to need about 24 days to catch up with the latest data.

We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.
