<dd>GIB (Genome Information Broker) provides an integrated search of Bacteria, Archaea, Eukaryota complete genome sequences.
<dd>Because the genome sequence data of <i>Clostridium perfringens SM101</i> (by The Institute for Genomic Research), <i>Rhodococcus sp. RHA1</i> (by University of British Columbia) were released, we incorporated them to GIB, and now you can search those data.</dd>
