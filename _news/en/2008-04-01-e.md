<html>Dr. Hideaki Sugawara, Professor of National Institute of Genetics and Director of Center for Information Biology and DNA Data Bank of Japan (CIB-DDBJ) was elected as one of the Honorary Membership of <a href="www.wfcc.info" target="_blank">the World Federation for Culture Collections (WFCC)</a> on March 16, 2008, and was presented the inaugural WFCC Medal Award for his long time outstanding contribution to the WFCC activities.<br><br>Dr. Sugawara, has been committing to the worldwide activities of the WFCC over many years in particular to Newsletter editing, training, information dissemination, providing statistics on collections worldwide and not least the direction of the World Data Centre for Microorganisms(WDCM). He constructs and maintains the WDCM web site on <a href="http://www.cib.nig.ac.jp/mcl/home-j.html" target="_blank">his own laboratory web site</a>. Through this web site, he continued to provide the scientific community for the microorganism researchers, as well as spread the useful information to all over the world. More recently he also contributed to establishment of OECD <a href="http://www.gbif.org/" target="_blank">Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF))</a> and the design of OECD Global Biological Resource Centre Network.<br><br>Appreciating his contribution to the WFCC for these years, the WFCC decided to elect him to the Honorary Membership of the WFCC and present the WFCC Medal, on the occasion of his retirement from the National Institute of Genetics(NIG). For the presentation ceremony, Dr. Ken-Ichiro Suzuki, Vice-President of the WFCC (and director of <a href="http://www.nite.go.jp/index-e.html" target="_blank">National Institute of Technology and Evaluation(NITE)</a>) visited Mishima-city (where NIG is located) on March 24, 2008. Dr. Suzuki read for the message of Dr. David Smith, President of the WFCC, and handed the award medal to Dr. Sugawara. Many DDBJ staffs congratulated his honor at the ceremony, together with his family.<br>

It is to be noted that this process was completed as smoothly as designed. With the previous system, we were able to process only 350,000 entries in a day, namely, we had to spend more than 4 days to complete 1.5M entries.<br><br>Although the mission was completed this time, we learned some lessons to improve the procedure further. You may claim that "2 days" is not quick enough.
