<p>We set up a research group called "Rinkai Hack" with a few volunteers to promote research education and human resources exchanges beyond the boundaries of informatics and animal/ plant research, with marine stations as the primary places of activity. The name Rinkai Hackathon is derived from "Rinkai (coastal, waterfront, or marine), Hack, marathon”.</p>

<p>We widely invite for participants of the event of this year, "RinkaiHackathon 2018". We will hold a symposium on June 10 and hands-on, three-day course June 11-13. The venue of the symposium is Fukuju Kaikan in Fukuyama Castle, and the venue of the hands-on course is the mukaijima marine station of Hiroshima University (Mukaijima, Onomichi, Hiroshima Prefecture). In addition to lectures by the committee members, several invited speakers are scheduled. For details, please see the event page.<br><a href="https://sites.google.com/view/rinkaihack/">https://sites.google.com/view/rinkaihack/</a></p>

<p>This year we are planning lectures and practical trainings on environmental DNA / metagenome and will provide experience-based learnings from DNA extraction from sea water to DNA sequence anaysis. Let’s learn the actual latest situation of the marine metagenomic analyses which is often taking up as a scientific topic recently. At the same time, we will set a discussion time in which participants discuss what of classical knowledge and system of biology does not change depending on the progress of technology.</p>

<p>As of this year, we will change the primary language during the event to English, because we want to encourage domestic and international-students to participate and also have opportunities to exchange outside the university. At the same time, we also encourage not only Japanese students who are confident in English but also students who are not as confident. If you cannot communicate well in English, the organizing staff will support you. (The committee members are also not very good at English. But we are doing it, somehow!! Que Sera Sera.)</p>
