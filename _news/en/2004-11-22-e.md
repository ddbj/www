<dd>GIB (Genome Information Broker) provides an integrated search of Bacteria, Archaea, Eukaryota complete genome sequences. Because the genome sequence data of <i>Streptococcus thermophilus LMG 18311</i> and <i>Streptococcus thermophilus CNRZ1066</i> were released by Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique, we incorporated them to GIB, and now you can search those data.
