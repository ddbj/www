We are currently experiencing an issue in the DRA submission system's validation process where error reports may sometimes contain SQL or Java errors. This is due to unstable connections to the database or website. Our team is actively investigating and working to resolve the issue.

When such reports are detected, DRA staff will reprocess the affected submissions as soon as they become aware of them. We kindly ask for your patience during this time.

We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and appreciate your understanding.
