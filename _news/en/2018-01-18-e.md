<p><span class="red">2018-01-23 The DRA submission service is resumed on 23th, Jan.</span></p>

<p>Due to the disk troubles, the DRA submission system has been unavailable since 21th, December, 2017. The submission system is planned to be restored in 22th, January (Monday). After restoration, users can submit new DRA submissions and change the hold date in D-way. For the accessioned DRA submissions, users can update metadata in D-way web interface if the data files are restored. All data files of the accessioned DRA submissions will be restored in 50 days. To update accessioned DRA submissions waiting for data file restoration, please request metadata update to <a href="/contact-e.html">DRA team</a>.</p>

<p>We apologize for this long-time service disruption.</p>

<p><span class="red">2018-01-22 DDBJ Center will stop the D-way submission services at Jan. 22 14:30-15:30 (planned) in order to restart DRA submission service. Thank you for your cooperation and understanding.</span></p>
