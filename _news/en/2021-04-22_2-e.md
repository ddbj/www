## Announcement
**Apologies for the delay of loading bulk sequence data from GenBank**    
In the present release, many of bulk sequence data are not included, because very large-scale sequence data come from GenBank.    
We are working to fix the problem, and the delay will be solved by the next periodical release.    
We regret any inconvenience it may cause and appreciate your understanding.
