2022-06-09 This problem was fixed.    

The NCBI locus tag prefix registration api has not been working for a few days.  
BioProject submission fails when a locus tag prefix is entered in the BioProject submission system.  
Please do not register a locus tag prefix in the BioProject submission system, instead, enter it in the BioSample submission system.  
Sorry for any inconvenience.
