<dd>Draft sequence of the chimpanzee genome was analyzed by the Chimpanzee Sequencing and Analysis Consortium, and published in <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v437/n7055/full/nature04072.html">Nature. 2005 Sep 1;437(7055):69-87.</a>
<dd>Chimpanzee is the humankind's closest living relative. Comparison of the genomes between human and chimpanzee will assist understanding human specific functions and the mechanism of evolution from primates to human.
<dd>The data was submitted to DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank International Nucleotide Sequence Databases as <a href="/ddbj/wgs-e.html">whole genome shotgun (WGS) </a>sequences data which is available via DDBJ <a href="http://getentry.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/top-e.html">getentry </a>system. Or the data is also available by downloading from <a href="/services/index-e.html ">anonymous ftp of the DDBJ" page</a> or WGS ftp site (AACZ.gz, AADA.gz).
<dd>Chimpanzee chromosome 22 DNA sequencing had already been completed by The International Chimpanzee Chromosome 22 Consortium in last May, and the result was published in <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v429/n6990/full/nature02564.html">Nature</a>.</dd>
