<dd>As was announced on Nov. 6, NIG E-mail servers are being targeted by a huge amount of SPAM mails. Therefore, at present, reception of all mails from outside NIG is temporarily suspended. Resume will be announced as soon as the trouble is removed. Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.</dd>
