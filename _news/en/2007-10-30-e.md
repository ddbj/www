<html>
<dd><a href="http://txsearch.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/top-e.html" target="_blank">TXSearch</a> is a retrieval system for a Taxonomy Database which was unified by DDBJ, GenBank and EMBL, which is developed by DDBJ. This should be helpful as a reference of taxonomic names when you submit nucleotide sequences to DDBJ.
<dd>Currently, TXsearch links to SRS which retrieves the related sequences, using the organism names, taxonomic names or ID numbers obtained by the TXsearch results. DDBJ changes this linked search system from SRS to <a href="http://arsa.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/top-e.html" target="_blank">ARSA (All-round Retrieval of Sequence and Annotation)</a> according to the following schedule.<br>

    <ul><b>Date:</b> November 2, 2007 (Fri) <br>(The changing works are scheduled in the afternoon, and the service does not suspend because of this works)<br></ul>
<dd>You can obtain the related entries information more rapidly with this change.</dd>
