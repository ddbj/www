<dd>DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank are collecting and maintaining the sequences from the proceeding genome projects as <a href="/ddbj/wgs-e.html">WGS</a> database. DDBJ provides the data on the page, <a href="/services/index-e.html ">Anonymous FTP of the DDBJ</a>, at the site, WGS data.<br>
<dd>Up to now, DDBJ named WGS data files at the FTP site after their organism names. However, since the number of WGS projects is significantly increasing, it is inconvenient to maintain the correspondence between files and projects. From now on, DDBJ has modified the naming convention and has renamed the WGS data files after the prefixes of their accession numbers. You can see the organism name corresponding to each file in the summary table.It will start from 14:00 on Jul. 20.</dd>
