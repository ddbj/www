<dd>GIB (Genome Information Broker)<br> provides an integrated search of Bacteria, Archaea, Eukaryota complete<br> genome sequences.<br> Because the genome sequence data of <i>Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae<br> MAFF 311018</i> was released by NIAS, we incorporated it to GIB, and<br> now you can search those data.</dd>
