<dd>DDBJ provides ClustalW services through WWW and E-mail. In the WWW ClustalW , we modified the data submit screen lay-out, and added some new options as follows.
<dd>

    <ul>
        <li>"Sequence input box" is transferred to the top of the page.</li>
        <li>"TYPE" options became independent from "ALIGN" options group.</li>
        <li> "AUTOMATIC" was newly added to the the "TYPE" options.<br>* When the "AUTOMATIC" is specified in the "TYPE" option, the ClustalW program identifies the sequence type (DNA/Protein) automatically and does the analysis using all default values.</li>
        <li>"p-distance"was added to the parameters of "DISTANCE" option.</li>
        <li>"KIMURA" option was integrated into the "DISTANCE" option.</li>
    </ul>
</dd>
</dd>
