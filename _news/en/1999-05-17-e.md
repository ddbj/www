<dd>Sequences of three regions of human chromosome 21, 21q21.1, 21q22.1,21q22.3-ter, have been submitted to DDBJ by Dr. Y. Sakaki's team of the Institute of Physical and Chemical Research (RIKEN).<br>
<dd>We assigned accession numbers, AP000136-AP000219, to these sequences, and released to public as HTG Division in DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank International Nucleotide Sequence Database.Prior to the present release, we already publicized another set of sequences of human chromosome 21 (21q22.1) with accession numbers AP000084-AP000135 which were submitted by the Japan Science Technology Corporati on (JST).<br>
<dd>In total we have made public about 13 Mbases of human genome sequence data.<br>
