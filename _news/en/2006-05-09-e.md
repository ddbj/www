<dd>GIB (Genome Information Broker)<br> provides an integrated search of Bacteria, Archaea, Eukaryota complete<br> genome sequences.
<dd>Because the genome sequence data of <i>Baumannia cicadellinicola Hc<br> (Homalodisca coagulata)</i> was released by The Institute for Genomic<br> Research, we incorporated it to GIB, and now you can search those data.</dd>
