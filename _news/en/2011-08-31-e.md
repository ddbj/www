The BioProject database represents a higher order organization of research projects and the corresponding data which is deposited into several archival databases maintained by members of the <a href="http://www.insdc.org/">INSDC</a>.Data submitted to <a href="http://www.insdc.org/">INSDC</a>-associated databases cross-reference the BioProject identifier to support navigation between the project and the project’s datasets. At the <a href="/index-e.html">DDBJ</a>, records in the following DDBJ archival databases are grouped: <a href="/index-e.html">DDBJ nucleotide sequence database</a>, <a href="/dra/index-e.html">Sequence Read Archive</a> and <a href="/dta/index-e.html">Trace Archive</a>.The BioProject record has information about a project's scope, material, objectives, funding source and general relevance categories.The <a href="/bioproject/index-e.html">BioProject</a> resource is a redesigned, expanded, replacement of the NCBI Genome Project resource.The <a href="/bioproject/index-e.html">DDBJ BioProject</a> issues internationally-recognized accession numbers with the prefix 'PRJD' to the submitted projects.Public project data are exchanged with the <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/">EBI</a> and <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject">NCBI</a>. * <span style="color: #ff0000;">The BioProject resource is released in phases. After the release of interactive submission system, we will start to accept new BioProject submissions.</span>
