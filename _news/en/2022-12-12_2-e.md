The following points were changed in the DRA submission at 8th December 2022.

* DRA Experiment: Spot Type was changed to [Library Layout](/dra/metadata-e.html#Library_Layout). Values are selected from "single" or "paired". In paired libraries, the directions of paired reads were automatically determined from the Instrument value (for example, Forward-Reverse for Illumina instruments).
* DRA Experiment: Nominal Length was changed to [Insert Size](/dra/metadata-e.html#Insert_Size). In paired libraries, this field was changed from required to optional.
* DRA Experiment: Nominal Sdev was removed from the DRA submission web interface. This fields can be described in the [XML submission](/dra/submission-e.html#upload-xml).
* DRA Run: sff was removed from the [File Type](/dra/metadata-e.html#File_Type). Please convert 454 sff files to fastq/bam and submit fastq/bam files.
