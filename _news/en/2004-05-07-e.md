<dd><a href="/services/past-services-e.html#gib">GIB (Genome Information Broker)</a> provides an integrated search of Bacteria, Archaea, Eukaryota complete genome sequences. Because the genome sequence data of <i>Parachlamydia sp. UWE25</i> (by University of Vienna), <i>Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough</i> <i>Photobacterium profundum ss9</i> (by TIGR), and <i>Listeria monocytogenes 4b F2365</i> (by CRIBI) were released, we incorporated them to GIB, and now you can search those data.</dd>
