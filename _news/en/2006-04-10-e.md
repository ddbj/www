<dd>GIB (Genome Information Broker)<br> provides an integrated search of Bacteria, Archaea, Eukaryota complete<br> genome sequences.
<dd>Because the genome sequence data of <i>Escherichia coli UTI89</i> (by<br> Washington University School of Medicine) and <i>Rickettsia bellii<br> RML369-C</i> (by CNRS) were released, we incorporated them to GIB,<br> and now you can search those data.</dd>
