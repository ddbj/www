#### Due to the recent increase in submissions to MSS and NSSS, accession number notifications are delayed. We kindly ask for your understanding.

* We ask the submitter to reduce mistakes in the organism and host names. Please verify the scientific names using [TXsearch](https://ddbj.nig.ac.jp/tx_search/) or the [NCBI Taxonomy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/taxonomy) before submission. Be especially careful to avoid typos. Please note that scientific name, not a common name, must be entered in organism or host.
* See [Identifiers](https://www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/ddbj/identifiers-e.html) and add appropriate qualifier key (isolate, strain etc.) to source feature as an identifier.

#### We especially ask submitters who use [MSS Application Form](https://mss.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/)

We are currently receiving a large number of submissions and asking the submitters wait until we can start the review process. Submissions without errors are given priority to complete the registration process.

* Submissions with issues, such as formatting or translation errors, contaminated sequences, reverse-oriented rRNA-ITS regions, or incorrect organism names, require significant correction work and will take a numerous time till accession numbers can be issued.
* Please make sure to run your files through the DDBJ validation tool provided in [Validation tools for MSS data files](https://www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/ddbj/mss-tool-e.html) site before uploading files.
  * For Windows users: Please use the GUI tool [UME](https://www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/ddbj/ume-e.html).
  * For Linux/macOS users: Please use the command-line tools [Parser](https://www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/ddbj/parser-e.html) and [transChecker](https://www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/ddbj/transchecker-e.html).
* Use the [MSS sample files](https://www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/ddbj/file-format-e.html#sample) as a reference.

We sincerely appreciate your cooperation.
