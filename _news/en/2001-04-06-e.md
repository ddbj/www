<dd><br>The Center for Information Biology (CIB) of the National Institute of Genetics (NIG) changed its name to "the Center for Information Biology and DNA Data Bank of Japan (CIB/DDBJ)" in April 2001. Since DDBJ began its operations in 1986, it had been regarded as a project of the DNA Research Center and then as a project of CIB. Now DDBJ is officially recognized as an organization of NIG, and continues its activities as ever.</dd>
