<dd>DDBJ is operating <a href="/E-mail/homology.html" target="_blank">FASTA, BLAST, SSEARCH</a> homology search systems and<br><a href="/E-mail/homology.html" target="_blank">clustalw</a> analysis system in WWW. Some new functions were recently added.<br>
<dd>- Making connection from FASTA/BLAST to clustalw, FASTA/BLAST retrieved sequences can be used on clustalw.<br>
<dd>- The result of clustalw can be shown on WWW.<br>
<dd>- Information about phylogenic trees (dnd, tree, bootstrap) can be shown in graphically using by TreeView in clustalw.<br>(You need to install TreeView software in your computer to see phylogenic trees. )</dd>
