<dd>GIB (Genome Information Broker) provides an integrated search of Bacteria, Archaea, Eukaryota complete genome sequences. Because the genome sequence data of <i>Pelodictyon luteolum DSM 273</i>, <i>Synechococcus sp. CC9902</i> and <i>Chlorobium chlorochromatii CaD3</i> (by JGI) were released, we incorporated them to GIB, and now you can search those data.</dd>
