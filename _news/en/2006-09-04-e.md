<dd>GIB (Genome Information Broker) provides an integrated search of Bacteria, Archaea, Eukaryota complete genome sequences.
<dd>Because the genome sequence data of <i>Synechococcus sp. CC9311</i> (by The Institute of Genomic Research), <i>Shewanella sp. MR-4</i> and <i>Shewanella sp. MR-7</i> (by Joint Genome Institute) were released, we incorporated them to GIB, and now you can search those data.</dd>
