<a href="http://getentry.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/top-e.html" target="_blank">getentry</a> is the entry retrieval system by accession numbers etc., which is provided by DDBJ via WWW and WebAPI.<br>At the suppress entries retrieval under the following conditions, the results are displayed in the format different from the specified format. The details are as follows:<dd>[Retrieval conditions]

    <ul>
        <li>database: DDBJ</li>
        <li>output format: FASTA(incl. CDS), DDBJ-XML, INSD-XML</li>
        <li>Result (how to obtain the result): E-mail, FTP</li>
    </ul>

    <p>[Phenomenon]<br>In the sequence retrieval of the suppress entries under the above conditions, the corresponding suppress entries are outputted in the DDBJ flat file format, although the different format was specified.<br>When the entries either do not fit the above conditions and/or are other than suppress entries, there are no problems. </p>

    <p>[Measure]<br>At present, DDBJ works on this problem. We will inform at this DBJ HP as soon as the problem is fixed. Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.</p>
