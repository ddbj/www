<dd>Although both new and old URLs had been active so far, the old URL was stopped on April 28, 2005. Therefore, if you still use an old URL, please update your bookmarks and links immediately.This change was caused by the change of the port number from #8080 to the standard port #80. Because of this change, troubles for accessing to Vector Screening System] due to port number setting will be resolved. Thank you very much for your understanding and cooperation.</dd>
