<dd>GIB (Genome Information Broker) provides an integrated search of Bacteria, Archaea, Eukaryota complete genome sequences.
<dd>Because the genome sequence data of <i> Escherichia coli APEC O1 </i> (by Iowa State University) and <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa UCBPP-PA14 </i> (by Massachusetts General Hospital) were released, we incorporated them to GIB, and now you can search those data.</dd>
