<dd>GIB (Genome Information Broker) provides an integrated search of Bacteria, Archaea, Eukaryota complete genome sequences.
<dd>Because the genome sequence data of <i>Francisella tularensis subsp. holarctica OSU18</i> (by Baylor College of Medicine) was released, we incorporated them to GIB, and now you can search those data.</dd>
