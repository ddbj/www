<dd>GIB (Genome Information Broker) provides an integrated search of Bacteria, Archaea, Eukaryota complete genome sequences. Because the genome sequence data of <i>Shigella boydii Sb227</i> and <i>Shigella dysenteriae Sd197</i> (by Microbial Genome Center of Chinese Ministry of Public Health) were released, we incorporated them to GIB, and now you can search those data.</dd>
