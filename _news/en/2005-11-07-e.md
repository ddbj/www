<dd>GIB (Genome Information Broker)ã€€provides an integrated search of Bacteria, Archaea, Eukaryota complete genome sequences. Because the genome sequence data of <i>Prochlorococcus marinus MIT 9312</i> and <i>Thiomicrospira denitrificans ATCC 33889</i> (by JGI) were released, we incorporated them to GIB, and now you can search those data.</dd>
