We inform you of a long nonbusiness day from May 3th to May 6th (JST) (called as "Golden Week" in Japan).

After 7th of May (Wed, JST), we will be able to respond to requests or questions which are received during the period. Our response after Golden Week is expected to take longer than usual.

Thank you in advance for your understanding and cooperation.
