In the DDBJ's Blast service provided via WWW, a bug was fixed. The details are as follows:

<ul>
    <li>Period: from Feb., 2009 to Oct. 22, 2009 (JST)</li>
    <li>Service: BLAST</li>
    <li>Condition: In the result view screen of "Text View" option, the horizontal line of the sequence and the corresponding check box (to select the sequence for the successive ClustalW analysis) was unmatched. As a result, in the following ClustalW analysis, when the "GO TO CLUSTALW" bottun was clicked, the sequence below the checked line was entered automatically. This defect was only in the result view screen, and the BLAST search result was all correct. </li>
    <li>Measure: The bug had already been removed, and at present, the location of the sequence and the check box is viewed correctly. </li>
</ul>

<p>DDBJ sincerely apologizes for your inconvenience during the long period.</p>
