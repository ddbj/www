<p class="attention">2016-08-18 This bug has been fixed.</p>

<p><a href="/news/en/2016-07-13_e.html">Due to a bug in the update release of the DRA XML schema at 13th July 2016</a>, a system error can occur in the Experiment page of the DRA submission system.</p>

<p>In the Experiment page, when [Save] and [Next (RUN)] buttons are clicked when values are not provided for the required fields "Library Source" and "Library Strategy", system error is caused. The DRA submission with this error can not be used.</p>

<p>As a temporal solution to prevent this error, we will block [Save] and [Next (RUN)] buttons when the "Library Source" and "Library Strategy" are not entered. We will release the submission system to fix the bug in late August.</p>

<p>We apologize for all the trouble this bug has caused.</p>
