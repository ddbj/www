Due to shortage of disk space, we stopped NCBI/EBI SRA data mirroring in April, 2017. We have resumed the mirroring since June, 2019 and now most of NCBI/EBI SRA data have been mirrored. You may check newly mirrored SRA runs in the published date of [sralist](https://ddbj.nig.ac.jp/public/ddbj_database/dra/meta/list/). [SRA data growth](/statistics/index-e.html#dra-release)
