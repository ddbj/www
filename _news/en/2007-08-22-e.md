<dd>

    <ul><br>
        <li><b>Service:</b>ClustalW<br></li>
        <li><b>Period:</b>from February 27, 2007 to August 7, 2007 18:00<br></li>
        <li><b>Condition:</b>When the "E-mail" is specified to obtain the results, "SHOW ALIGNMENT SCORE" and "SHOW SEQNO_RANGE SCORE" options were not active in spite of these options were specified. And accordingly, the Alignment scores were not included in the obtained results.<br></li>
        <li><b>Cause:</b>program error<br></li>
        <li><b>Results:</b>Fortunately, the results themselves were correct.</li>
    </ul>
<dd>The program error had already been fixed, and now, the alignment scores are displayed in the results.<br>We deeply apologize for any inconveniences that this may have caused to our users.</dd>
