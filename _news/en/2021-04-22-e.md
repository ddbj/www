The JGA system released at September, 2020, has employed scp as the data transfer protocol with IP address restriction.     
To improve usability and security, the protocol was switched from scp to sftp at 10:00 22th April 2021 and the IP address restriction was removed.
Please see the [JGA submission steps](/jga/submission-step-e.html) and [Download steps](/jga/download-e.html) pages for how to upload and download files by using sftp.

The scp/ssh is still available in ftp-private.ddbj.nig.ac.jp used for uploading and downloading DRA/GEA files.
