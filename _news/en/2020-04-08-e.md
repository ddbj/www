<p>Excel, Singularity/Docker container images and SRA xsd for <a href="/dra/index-e.html">DDBJ Sequence Read Archive (DRA)</a> XML submission are available in <a href="https://github.com/ddbj/submission-excel2xml">Github</a>. After entering Submission, Experiment and Run metadata in the Excel, you can generate and validate XMLs by running the Singularity/Docker containers.
