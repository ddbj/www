<dd>GIB (Genome Information Broker)<br> provides an integrated search of Bacteria, Archaea, Eukaryota completet<br> genome sequences. Because the genome sequence data of <i>Methanosphaera<br> stadtmanae DSM 3091</i> was released by Goettingen Genomics Laboratory,<br> we incorporated it to GIB, and now you can search those data.</dd>
