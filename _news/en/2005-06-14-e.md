<dd>Recently, the submissions of the sequences derived from environmental samples have rapidly been increased. To accommodate such submissions, a new division, ENV, has been created.
<dd>This division contains the sequences obtained via direct molecular isolation such as PCR, DGGE, or any anonymous method. In the past, the sequences derived from environmental samples belonged to taxonomic divisions, mainly BCT. At DDBJ, the retrofit to transfer relevant entries from taxonomic divisions to the ENV division starts in the periodical release 62 (Jun, 2005), and ends by the periodical release 63 (Sep, 2005). Please note that, during this transitional period, some entries to be placed in the ENV division will be found in other divisions.</dd>
