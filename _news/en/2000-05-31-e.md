<dd>We developed a homepage <b><a href="http://calathea.genes.nig.ac.jp:8080/">"DDBJ/CIB Human Genomics Studio"</a></b>, which is a product of research and development project of DDBJ (DNA Data Bank of Japan) and CIB (Center for Information Biology, National Institute of Genetics).It aims at providing human genomic sequences and results of genome informatics<br>analyses. In particular, we are collecting and assembling human draft sequences, which are rapidly increasing in number, to construct the entire sequences of human chromosomes. The results will be placed in this homepage soon.</dd>
