    <dd>International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC), consisted of DDBJ, EBI and NCBI, hold the international collaborators meeting every year.In 2010, the meeting was held at EBI in UK, 19-21 May, to discuss practical matters to maintain and update nucleotide sequence data archives; DDBJ, EMBL-Bank, GenBank, Sequence Read Archive and Trace Archive. As a result of travel disruptions relating to the Icelandic volcano, the meeting was shorter than expected. Despite these difficulties, we believe that we made significant progress at the meeting. The outcomes of the meeting are summarized <a href="/activities/index-e.html#2010">here.</a> </dd>
