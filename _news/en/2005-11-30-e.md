<dd>GIB (Genome Information Broker) provides an integrated search of Bacteria, Archaea, Eukaryota complete genome sequences. Because the genome sequence data of <i>Brucella melitensis biovar Abortus</i> (by Oak Ridge National Laboratory) and <i>Staphylococcus aureus RF122</i> (by University of Minnesota) were released, we incorporated them to GIB, and now you can search those data.</dd>
