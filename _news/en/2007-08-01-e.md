<dd><span class="icon_d-triangle font-bold">Outline of revision</span><br> To follow the Japanese law of protecting personal information, DDBJ will delete both phone and fax numbers, and E-mail address from the flat files of the entries submitted to DDBJ. It would be also helpful to protect the DDBJ releases against SPAM mail senders. DDBJ plans to retorofit the entries submitted to DDBJ, not to GenBank or EMBL, by periodical release 72, the end of December 2007.<br> <br> Up to now, database users can contact to sequence submitters by using their E-mail addresses on the DDBJ flat files. However, after this revision, it will become difficult to contact submitters. When you wish to contact to the submitter(s) of an entry of your interest, please contact us with the inquiry form with reasons briefly; i.e. asking to transfer cloned sequences, etc, then we will forward your messeage to the submitter(s).<br> <br> Thank you very much for your understanding and cooperation.
