<p>The DDBJ BioSample started accepting new submissions from February 12. INSDC members have been assigning strain-level taxonomy IDs to microbes whose genomes have been submitted to the INSDC. The INSDC stopped assigning strain-level taxonomy IDs on February 10 and BioSample IDs define microbial genomes instead of strain-level taxonomy IDs.</p>
