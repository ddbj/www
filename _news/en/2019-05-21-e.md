<p>Genomic Expression Archive (GEA) is recommended by Scientific Data as a public database of functional genomics data such as gene expression and epigenetics.
    Both microarray- and sequence-based data are accepted in the <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/help/magetab_spec.html">MAGE-TAB</a> format in compliance with <a href="http://fged.org/projects/miame/">MIAME</a> and <a href="http://fged.org/projects/minseqe/">MINSEQE</a> guidelines, respectively. GEA issues <a href="/gea/overview-e.html#acc">accession numbers</a>, E-GEAD-n to experiment and A-GEAD-n to array design.</p>

<p>GEA metadata will be indexed by <a href="https://www.omicsdi.org/">EBI Omics DI</a></p>
