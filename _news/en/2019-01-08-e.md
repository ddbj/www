According to the <a href="https://www.nig.ac.jp/nig/research/organization-top/organization">reorganization of National Institute of Genetics</a> from 1st January 2019, our center name is changed from "DDBJ Center" to "Bioinformation and DDBJ Center". Old center names in our website will be updated.
