We have imported the past application data and re-started the NBDC application and JGA systems at 17:30, 15th March. [Email notifications](/news/en/2021-03-12-e.html) regarding the imported data will be sent.

To import past application data before new JGA system release at 30th September 2020, the NBDC application and JGA systems will be unavailable. It takes more time than expected for data import, the downtime is extended from 12th to 15th.    

10th (Wednesday)-15th (Monday) March 2021 NBDC application and JGA systems downtime

We apologize for the inconvenience.
