    <font color="#FF0000">If you are planning continuous registration, please start registration after new SAKURA is introduced to the public, or immediately finish continuous registration. </font><br>If you have already started continuous registration, please complete it on current system at once, or stop it and reenter on the new system.<br>We intend to release the new SAKURA on April 20.
