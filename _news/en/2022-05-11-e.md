We are planning to open a new application form for Mass Submission System (MSS) in the future. The new application system works under the D-way authentication system, and the submitters can directly upload the submission files during the application. 
After starting the new application form, we will close the following services.

* Former MSS application form
* Applying MSS submission by email
* Receiving the submission files by email

We will announce again when the new MSS application form is available.
