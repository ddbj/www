The publishing of registered data with accession numbers is resumed on 3rd April. Due to the long suspension period, it is taking longer than usual to update the search system getentry/DDBJ Search and DRA data release to the public ftp site, but we will release it gradually.    
    
All services including registration and update are expected to resume next week. We are very sorry, but please wait for a while.    
    
We appreciate your continued support of Bioinformation and DDBJ Center.
