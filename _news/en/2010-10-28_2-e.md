    <dd><a href="http://www.src.riken.go.jp/english/" target="_blank">Center for Genomic Medicine, RIKEN</a> analyzed the whole genome sequence of a Japanese male which had been genotyped by the <a href="http://hapmap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/" target="_blank">International HapMap project</a>. As a result, the research group identified over 3 million single nucleotide variations (SNVs), 5,319 deletions smaller than 10 kb as well as 3 million base pairs of novel genome sequences not found in the human reference genome (<a href="http://www.riken.jp/engn/r-world/info/release/press/2010/101025/index.html" target="_blank">Press release from RIKEN</a>).<a href="/dra/index-e.html">DDBJ Sequence Read Archive</a> has released the sequencing data of the Illumina Genome Analyzer II used in this analysis under the accession number <a href="https://ddbj.nig.ac.jp/public/ddbj_database/dra/DRA000/DRA000222/">DRA000222</a>.</dd>
