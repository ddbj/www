<p>According to the <a href="https://www.nig.ac.jp/nig/about-nig/covid19bcp">National Institute of Genetics prevention measures for the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infectious Disease</a>, we are promoting "work from home". We plan to provide our services such as submission, update, data release of database records, and NIG supercomputer as usual. However, due to changes in the COVID-19 situation, we may delay a part of our services requiring “come to work”. We appreciate your understanding and cooperation.</p>
