<dd>GIB (Genome Information Broker) provides an integrated search of Bacteria, Archaea, Eukaryota complete genome sequences. Because the genome sequence data of <i>Legionella pneumophila Paris</i>, and <i>Legionella pneumophila Lens</i> were released by Institut Pasteur, we incorporated them to GIB, and now you can search those data.
