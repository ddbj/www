For all users of DDBJ,    
    
Thank you for your support of our DDBJ services. We wish to continue servicing sequence analysis tools to fully exploit our databases, but the stable maintenance turned out difficult due to our shortage of resources. 
From [the NIG supercomputer maintenance at 10th-19th November 2021](/news/en/2021-10-15-e.html), we tentatively close our [Blast](http://ddbj.nig.ac.jp/blast/) and [ClustalW](https://clustalw.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/) services. 
The restart date is not yet scheduled.    
We apologize for the inconvenience incurred, and do our best to resume our services.    
    
Masanori Arita, Head of DDBJ Center
