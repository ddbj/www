<p class="bold">[ Announcement]</p>

<ul>
    <li>The delay of loading bulk sequence data from GenBank and ENA has been solved</li>
    <li><a href="/news/ja/2020-03-19.html">Announcement for changing structure of directories on anonymous FTP site</a></li>
    <li>Apologies for mixture of TPA entries in bulk sequence data from ENA:

        <p>Intrinsically, the periodical release should be made only primary data, so, <a href="/ddbj/tpa-e.html">TPA data</a> should not be included. However, due to some disorders of sorting sequence data, TPA entries in bulk sequence data from ENA were continuously included like as primary ones at DDBJ. The problem was found when we were preparing to change the structure of directories on anonymous FTP site (See above.).</p>

        <p>In the present release, we fixed the problem, so, the number of records looks like decrease from the last one. There are mistakes in the statistics of the periodical releases since rel. 113, June 2018, and the correction of them is under consideration.</p>

        <p>We apologize for any inconvenience caused by this issue.</p>
