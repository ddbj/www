195 data files placed as TPA-TSA were duplicated as TSA on the DDBJ FTP site.     

Period: from 6th March, 2021 to 4th July, 2023    
Extent of the impact: FTP site [ddbj.nig.ac.jp/public/ddbj_database/tsa/HB/](https://ddbj.nig.ac.jp/public/ddbj_database/tsa/HB/ )    

Currently, [the 195 data files](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cX9457WrTiV9sU-cHwLUp70w2Az0PBg2/view?usp=drive_link ) have been removed from the TSA site.    

We apologize for all the trouble the failure has caused.
