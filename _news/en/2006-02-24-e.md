<dd>GIB (Genome Information Broker)<br> provides an integrated search of Bacteria, Archaea, Eukaryota complete<br> genome sequences.<br> Because the genome sequence data of <i>Anaplasma phagocytophilum HZ</i>,<br> <i>Ehrlichia chaffeensis Arkansas</i> and <i>Neorickettsia sennetsu<br> Miyayama</i> (by TIGR) were released, we incorporated them to GIB,<br> and now you can search those data.</dd>
