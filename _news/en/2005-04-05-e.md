<dd>GIB (Genome Information Broker) provides an integrated search of Bacteria, Archaea, Eukaryota complete genome sequences.Because the genome sequence data of <i>Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Choleraesuis SC-B67</i> was released by Chang Gung Genomic Medical Center, we incorporated it to GIB, and now you can search those data.
