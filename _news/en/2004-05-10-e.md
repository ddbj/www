<dd>In the search and analysis services by E-mail,"email_request_id", a new option to request Request ID notifying mail started.<br>
<dd>    Services: FASTA, BLAST, SSEARCH, S&amp;W SEARCH, ClustalW<br>
<dd>     Example (request): email_request_id 1<br>
<dd>When the request of the Request ID notifying mail is specified in this option, request ID for user's submitted query is sent by e-mail,and the user can confirm the Internet congestion at Traffic information page on <a href="/E-mail/homology.html">Search and Analysis</a> using this ID.<br>
<dd>When request ID notification is not selected, an e-mail to notify request ID is not sent to the user. For ClustalW, Request ID had been notified to all users without specifying any options so far.<br>
<dd>But, hereafter, if you would like to be notified request ID for your query, you need to specify "email_request_id" option like another homology services.</dd>
