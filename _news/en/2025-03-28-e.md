We sincerely apologize for the prolonged downtime of our submission system, which has caused significant inconvenience to our users. For those wishing to submit new data, please submit your data to NCBI or EBI.  

We deeply regret that the release of registered data required for manuscript publication is still delayed. If you need a letter of explanation (apology) for the journal, we will issue a letter upon request. Please feel free to contact us if necessary.

We appreciate your continued support of Bioinformation and DDBJ Center.
