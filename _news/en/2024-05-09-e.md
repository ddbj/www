As previously mentioned, regarding 
[the requirement to state the location and date of sample collection](/news/en/2024-02-01-e.html ), 
from June 2024, the /country qualifier will be renamed to [/geo_loc_name](/ddbj/qualifiers-e.html#geo_loc_name ) qualifier.    

Additionally, in the difficult cases to describe the two attributes, 
[geo_loc_name](/biosample/attribute-e.html#geo_loc_name ) and 
[collection_date](/biosample/attribute-e.html#collection_date )
for [BioSample submission](/biosample/index-e.html ), 
[missing values](https://www.insdc.org/submitting-standards/missing-value-reporting/ ) 
will be applied more strictly.    

Due to renaming of the qualifier, the following services will be suspended or affected for the following periods.
