        <li><b>Period:</b>from 16:06 on November 6, 2007 to 11:49 on November 9, 2007<br></li>
        <li><b>Condition:</b>In the ClustalW, either in the WWW or in the E-mail, when the "E-mail" was selected as the method of receiving the analysis results, the result (E-mail) was not returned.

            <p></p>
        </li>
        <li><b>Cause:</b>The E-mail program of the ClustalW was not active during the above period<br></li>
