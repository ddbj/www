[International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC)](https://www.insdc.org/) improves utility of sequence data and sample traceability by making sample location and collection date description mandatory.  

* Location of collection: Specification of where the biological sample was collected, at a minimum, by using the names for countries, oceans, or seas. Relevant attributes are, BioSample [geo_loc_name](/biosample/attribute-e.html#geo_loc_name) and DDBJ [country](/ddbj/qualifiers-e.html#country).
* Date and time of collection: Date and time when the specimen was collected, at least to the nearest year. Relevant attributes are, BioSample and DDBJ [collection_date](/biosample/attribute-e.html#collection_date).

In cases where this information cannot be provided (e.g., pathogen samples for which this information would lead to identifiability of a human) or is not relevant (e.g., study of a model organism lab stock or an established cell line), you can declare an appropriate exemption using the exemption terms defined in the [INSDC Missing Value Reporting Standards](https://www.insdc.org/submitting-standards/missing-value-reporting/).

**Timeline:**

* By the end of May 2023, geo_loc_name and collection_date will be required in all BioSample packages.  
* By the end of December 2024, country and collection_date will be required in all sequence submissions to DDBJ.
