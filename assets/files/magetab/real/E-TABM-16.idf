"Experiment Description"	"This experiment is a test of a reagent that can provide a basis for performance assessments on Affymetrix RAE230A,  CodeLink UniSet Rat I, and Agilent G4130A rat oligonucleotide arrays.   The reagent is a set of two mixed tissue RNA samples formulated to contain different ratios of RNA for each of four rat tissues (brain, liver, kidney, and testes).   The analytes in this assay bind to a subset of gene probes that were matched across platforms to the same UniGene cluster or GenBank accession number, were determined to be tissue-selective on each of the 3 platforms using average baseline expression levels in single tissue samples from control animals, and have signal intensities that span the dynamic range of each platform.   This reagent forms the basis of a ratiometric assay in a complex biological background that can be used to objectively assess the effect of different array processing methods and conditions on microarray data comparability within and across platforms, and could be a paradigm for similar performance standards for mouse and human arrays."

"Protocol Description"	"Rodents received certified rodent diet #5002C ad lib and drinking water purified by reverse osmosis.   The animals were acclimated for 6 days prior to euthanasia.   The animals were on a 12 hr light/dark cycle and euthanasia was performed consistently within 4-6  hr after the start of the light cycle. Each batch was made up of 8 animals from the same shipment. "	"After euthanasia in a slow charged CO2 chamber, the rats were immediately decapitated to allow for rapid access to the brain.  Four organs were quickly removed in the following order:  brain, liver, kidneys, and testes.  The whole brain, including brain stem but excluding pituitary gland, was collected.  Tissues were quickly dissected into 0.5 cm sections while submersed in RNAlater (Ambion, Austin, TX) in sterile petri plates and placed into 50 mL tubes containing RNAlater at a ratio of 10 mL of RNAlater per 1g of tissue.  Tissues were stored at 4�°C for a minimum of 24 hrs and a maximum of 72 hrs.<br><br>All tissue RNAs were isolated using a Tempest rotor-stator homogenizer (VirTis, Gardiner, NY) and Qiagen RNA isolation kits (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA), following the manufacturer�s protocol.   Brain RNA was isolated using QIAzol reagent, followed by a cleanup step with an RNeasy Maxi kit.  Kidney, liver, and testes were homogenized in 15 ml RLT buffer per mg of tissue, diluted to 30 ml RLT per mg, and isolated on RNeasy Maxi columns using 15 ml homogenate per column.   After an additional cleanup step on RNeasy Maxi columns, RNA was aliquoted and stored at -70�°C.<br><br>"	"Mix1 consisted of 200 ug testis RNA,  600 ug liver RNA, 800 ug brain RNA, and 400 ug kidney RNA. 50 ug aliquots of each mixture were frozen at -70C."
