"Publication Title"	"Apoptosis regulation in tetraploid cells"									
"Experiment Description"	"During the oncogenic process, tetraploidy is a candidate intermediate stage leading from diploidy to aneuploidy. The aim of our experiment was to establish tetraploid clones and to characterize their transcriptome."

"Protocol Description"	"RKO cells were grown in McCoy' 5A medium supplemented with 10%FCS. In order to generate tetraploid and diploid clones, the cell line RKO containing ~5% tetraploid cells was subcloned by limiting dilution into diploid and tetraploid clones. One diploid clone was transfected with a cDNA encoding H2B-GFP, selected in blasticidine (20 ﾵg/ml), FACS-separated into subsets of cells enriched in a diploid or tetraploid DNA content to generate diploﾕd and tetraploid H2B-GFP-expressing clones. "	"Tetraploid HCT116 clones were generated upon treatment with cytochalasin D (0.6 ﾵg/ml, 48h) or nocodazole (100nM, 48h).  For microarray assay, established diploid and tetraploid clones were collected during exponential growth with a cell scrapper in 1ml RLT lysis buffer with beta-mercaptoethanol (10ml/ml)."	"Total RNA was isolated from using Rneasy micro elute kit (Qiagen, Courtaboeuf, France) according to manufacturer instructions. Briefly Cells was mixed with 350 ul RLT buffer with Beta Mercaptoethanol 1%. Then add 350 ul ethanol 70% and mixed thoroughly by"	"Pools of RNA (Pool1 or Pool2), obtained by mixing equal amounts (500 ng) of total RNA from each of the 8 cell line samples, constituted the reference in each group.

Microarray images were alysed by using Feature Extraction software version A.7.5.1 from Agilent technologies. Defaults settings were used."	"Raw data files from the Agilent Feature Extraction software A.6.1.1 for image alysis were then imported into Resolver(TM) system for gene expression data alysis from Rosetta Inpharmatics. Then combined experiments were generated, to obtain average values from the replicates and dye swap experiments in order to avoid dye incorporation bias. Microarray data were processed and combined using the Rosetta Resolver system described in Stoughton and Dai (2002)."
