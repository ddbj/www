"Protocol Description"	"Cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin to a total number of ~ 3x10^8 cells. Dilute cell density to 3 x10^5/ml every two to three days. Split and feed 16 hours before cross-linking the cells."	"Day 1 Cross linking cells and chromatin extraction/preparation<br>1. Grow or harvest 1x10^8 cells. Collect the cells by centrifuging at 1200 rpm for 5-8 minutes.<br>2. Resuspend the cells in pre-warmed 50 ml serum free media in a glass flask. Add 0.5 ml of formaldehyde solution in fume hood (37%; final concentration 0.37%) to cross link DNA-protein interactions. Incubate at room temperature with gentle agitation for 10 minutes.<br>3. Add 3.15 ml of 2M glycine (final concentration of 0.125M) and incubate for 5 minutes at room temperature with gentle shaking to stop the cross linking reaction.<br>4. Transfer the cells to a 50 ml Falcon tube on ice and centrifuge the cells at 1200 rpm for 6 minutes at 4C.<br>5. Remove supernatant and resuspend the pellet with 1.5 ml ice-cold PBS and keep on ice. Centrifuge the cells at 2000 rpm for 5 minutes at 4ﾰC.<br>Add leupeptin, PMSF and sodium butyrate to CLB immediately before use<br>6. Gently resuspend the cell pellet in 1.5X pellet volume (this is approximate) of cell lysis buffer (CLB). Resuspend the cells by pipetting up and down and incubate for 10 minutes on ice. Centrifuge at 2500 rpm for 5 minutes at 4ﾰC to collect nuclei.<br>Keep NLB at room temperature<br>7. Remove the supernatant and resuspend the nuclei in 1.2 ml of nuclear lysis buffer (NLB) and incubate on ice for 10 minutes. Add 0.72 ml of IP dilution buffer (IPDB) and transfer to a 5 ml falcon tube.<br>8. Sonicate. First clean the tip with 0.1M HCl for one minute, then 0.1% SDS then rinse with HPLC water for one minute.

"Microarrays were scanned using a ScanArray 4000 confocal laser-based scanner (Perkin Elmer). Mean spot intensities from images were quantified using ScanArray Express (Perkin Elmer) with background subtraction. Spots affected by dust were manually flagged as ﾓnot foundﾔ and subsequently excluded from the analysis. Wiggle tracks were generated combining data of all replicates to the median using an R script (see also ftp://ftp.sanger.ac.uk/pub/encode/). Tracks can be visualised under http://www.genome.ucsc.edu/ENCODE/encode.hg17.html activating the Sanger ChIP tracks in the ENCODE Chromatin Immunoprecipitation section."	"The Data of all replicates of a ChIP experiment were combined to the median using an R script (see also ftp://ftp.sanger.ac.uk/pub/encode/). It takes the ""Ch2 N Ratio of Means"" values over all technical replicates, where ""Ch2 N Ratio of Means"" equals the ratio of the enriched and non-enriched fractions (both background corrected and global normalised) and combines the values to the median. Tracks of this median data can be visualised using the UCSC genome browser under http://www.genome.ucsc.edu/ENCODE/encode.hg17.html activating the Sanger ChIP tracks in the ENCODE Chromatin Immunoprecipitation section."
