## Group <a name="group"></a>

In [the new account system](account-integration-e.html), submissions and
NBDC data submission and use applications are managed through 'group'.
By using group, a principal investigator and a researcher are able to
edit submitted records collaboratively, and limit submitters by adding
and removing group members without sharing account credentials. When an
account holder is sole submitter, submission is linked to default group
having one member, the account holder.

The owner can send an invitation email to another account holder. If the
holder accepts invitation, he/she is added to the group.

The owner can remove a member without his/her permission.

### Submitter group <a name="subgrp"></a>

The submission application to NBDC is managed by submitter group. NBDC
creates JGA submissions linked to approved applications and applicants
can submit their data.

Update request should be applied from the same group which applied the
initial submission application. The submitter can add data to a new
submission linked to approved update application.

The owner can remove a member without his/her permission. However, you
need to request member addition to NBDC.
