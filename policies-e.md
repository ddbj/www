## Data Submission Guideline {#data-submission-guideline}
This is a guideline for submitting data to the databases operated by the Bioinformation and DDBJ Center (hereinafter referred to as 'Center'), and sets forth the rights of submitters and items to be observed.

### Data Processing {#data-processing}
Center may correct obvious errors and inconsistencies, convert format or add relevant information to data provided by submitters, for maintaining quality and improving usability of the data. Center must obtain submitter's permission in cases where it will process data beyond such purpose. 

### Rights and Duties of Submitter {#right-and-duty-of-submitter}
Excluding the portion modified by Center, the contents and quality of the data are responsibility of the submitters. Submitter can update his/her data. Submitter should answer inquiries from users and person in charge of the database regarding submitted data, and therefore should correctly maintain its registered contact information. If there are any matters that need to be determined by submitters, we will attempt to contact the submitter wherever possible, however, if we decide that it is necessary, we will consult the superior of the organization where submitter belongs to and follow the judgement of the superior.
Data must not be submitted without obtaining the permission of the Principal Investigator.
When submitting data derived from a human subject, you must comply with the '[Submission of Research Data from Human Subjects](#submission-of-human-data)'.
 
### Data Release {#data-release}
Scientific data provided by submitter to Center's database will be disclosed to the public in accordance with the Data Release Policy as set forth below, according to the categories of unrestricted-access data or controlled-access data. Center will not assume any responsibility for any damage arising from such disclosure, relating to copyrights, rights to obtain patents or all rights to other intellectual property of third parties (including submitter), and in the case Center incurs any damage, submitter shall compensate such damage of Center.

#### Data Release Policy {#data-release-policy}
Center discloses data to the public in accordance with the following principles. In cases 2 or 3, it is deemed that submitter's approval is obtained in advance and therefore data will be released without making any further confirmation to submitter.

  1.  When the submitter requests us to release the data.
  1.  When the accession number corresponding to data is published and is confirmed. 'Publish' means to disclose the accession number to an unspecified number of people by announcement through various media such as academic papers (including 'in press' articles made public by on-line preview and preprint server), academic meetings, Internet or press reports. It also includes accession numbers cited in published data, such as accession numbers cited by DDBJ/DRA/GEA/BioSample records. It will not include cases when a third party (excluding submitter) publishes another person's accession number through negligence.
  1.  When the specified hold-date set by submitter arrives.

### Fair Use of Submission System {#fair-use-policy}
#### Use of File Upload Area {#data-upload-area}
Submitter's private area for uploading files for submission to the database is a temporary place for files until such data submission is completed. Because the database itself provides an almost permanent data storage function, we reserve the right to delete any file stored in the private area longer than a half year, while we attempt to inform submitter before deleting the files. We accept no responsibility for the loss of data in the private area regardless of whether such loss occurs through our intention or negligence. 

#### Creation of Submission Account {#account}
  * User is deemed to agree with Center's Terms of Use and policies when creating an account.

### Submission of Research Data from Human Subjects {#submission-of-human-data}
#### Before Submitting Data {#before-submission}

In principle, make sure to remove any direct personal identifiers of human subjects from your metadata.

When you are submitting human data obtained from researches using human derived samples, except widely utilized and generally available samples of academically established value (\*1), make sure the followings. 

  * The research plan describing experimental methods and human subjects generating the data to be provided has been approved by the institutional review board and by the head of institution who oversees the research.
  * The research plan and the informed consent documents describe that data from human subjects are deposited to databases and are shared among domestic and overseas researchers. 
 
\*1 HeLa whole genome sequence data should be submitted to the [NCBI Database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap/).

#### Controlled-Access and Database {#access-control-and-databases}
Before submitting human data, please consider whether controlled-access is required or not when releasing data, on the basis of informed consents obtained from human subjects.

##### Controlled-Access Database {#controlled-access}
Submit your data to the controlled-access database '[Japanese Genotype-phenotype Archive (JGA)](/jga/index-e.html)'. Before submitting your data to JGA, you need to present an application (for data to be submitted) to the Data Access Committee of the [National Bioscience Database Center (NBDC)](https://humandbs.biosciencedbc.jp/en/) of Japan Science and Technology Agency and obtain the Committee's approval upon review thereby. 

#### Unrestricted-Access Database {#unrestricted-access}
Submit your data to unrestricted-access databases [DDBJ Sequence Read Archive (DRA)](/dra/index-e.html), [Genomic Expression Archive (GEA)](/gea/index-e.html) or [DDBJ](/ddbj/index-e.html). To submit data corresponding to personal identification code (\*2) in unrestricted-access databases, you need to present an application (for data to be submitted) to the Data Access Committee of the NBDC and obtain the Committee's approval upon review thereby. In principle, the two points of 'Before submitting your data' must be fulfilled, and the informed consent documents must explain that the data is shared publicly from the databases without restriction. 
In regard to review of data that does not fall under personal identification code, please contact the NBDC.

\*2 Please refer to the NBDC FAQs, in regard to personal identification code.
