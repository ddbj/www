Excluding the portion modified by Center, the contents and quality of the data are responsibility of the submitters. Submitter can update his/her data. Submitter should answer inquiries from users and person in charge of the database regarding submitted data, and therefore should correctly maintain its registered contact information. If there are any matters that need to be determined by submitters, we will attempt to contact the submitter wherever possible, however, if we decide that it is necessary, we will consult the superior of the organization where submitter belongs to and follow the judgement of the superior.
Data must not be submitted without obtaining the permission of the Principal Investigator.
When submitting data derived from a human subject, you must comply with the '[Submission of Research Data from Human Subjects](#submission-of-human-data)'.

### Data Release {#data-release}
Scientific data provided by submitter to Center's database will be disclosed to the public in accordance with the Data Release Policy as set forth below, according to the categories of unrestricted-access data or controlled-access data.

  1.  When the accession number corresponding to data is published and is confirmed. 'Publish' means to disclose the accession number to an unspecified number of people by announcement through various media such as academic papers (including 'in press' articles made public by on-line preview and preprint server), academic meetings, Internet or press reports. It also includes accession numbers cited in published data, such as accession numbers cited by DDBJ/DRA/GEA/BioSample records. It will not include cases when a third party (excluding submitter) publishes another person's accession number through negligence.

### Fair Use of Submission System {#fair-use-policy}
#### Use of File Upload Area {#data-upload-area}
Submitter's private area for uploading files for submission to the database is a temporary place for files until such data submission is completed. Because the database itself provides an almost permanent data storage function, we reserve the right to delete any file stored in the private area longer than a half year, while we attempt to inform submitter before deleting the files. We accept no responsibility for the loss of data in the private area regardless of whether such loss occurs through our intention or negligence.

#### Creation of Submission Account {#account}

When you are submitting human data obtained from researches other than researches falling outside the scope of laws, regulations and guidelines (for example, researches using widely utilized and generally available samples of academically established value (\*1)), make sure the followings.

* The research plan describing experimental methods, research targets (for example, diseases and samples), and ways of data publication and sharing, has been approved by the institutional review board and by the head of institution who oversees the research.
* The research plan and the informed consent documents describe that human data are deposited to databases, in addition, when the data are to be deposited as controlled-access data, "the data are to be shared among domestic and international researchers including those belong to private companies, who meet user requirements", and when the data are to be deposited as unrestricted-access data, "the data are to be published on the Internet in a form that anyone can view and access".
* Before submitting data, you need to present an application (for data to be submitted) to the Human Data Review Board of DBCLS and obtain the Board’s approval upon review thereby.

\*1 HeLa whole genome sequence data should be submitted to the [NCBI Database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap/).

#### Controlled-Access and Database {#access-control-and-databases}
