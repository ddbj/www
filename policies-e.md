#### Before submitting your data<a name="before"></a>

For submitting data from human subjects (human data) to the databases of DDBJ center, it is submitter's responsibility to ensure that the dignity and right of human subject are protected in accordance with all applicable laws, ordinances, guidelines and policies of submitter's institution. In principle, make sure to remove any direct personal identifiers of human subjects from your data to be submitted.

When you are submitting human data from samples except widely utilized and generally available samples of academically established value (\*1), make sure the followings.

  - The research plan describing experimental methods and human subjects has been approved by the institutional review board and by the head of institution who oversees the research.
  - The research plan and the informed consent documents describe that data from human subjects are deposited to databases and are shared among domestic and overseas researchers.

\*1 [HeLa whole genome sequence data](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-14-080.html) should be submitted to [NCBI dbGaP](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap).

#### Controlled-access and databases

Before submitting human data, please consider whether controlled-access for the data is required or not (i.e. unrestricted access) on the basis of informed consents obtained from human subjects.

Controlled-access database  
: Submit your data to the controlled-access database ["Japanese Genotype-phenotype Archive (JGA)"](/jga/index-e.html).  
Before submitting your data to JGA, you need an approval for data submission from [National Bioscience Database Center (NBDC)](https://humandbs.biosciencedbc.jp/en/data-submission) of Japan Science and Technology Agency.

Unrestricted-access database  
: Submit your data to unrestricted-access databases [DDBJ Sequence Read Archive (DRA)](/dra/index-e.html) or [DDBJ](/ddbj/websub-e.html).  
To submit human data corresponding to personal identification code (\*2), you need an approval for data submission from [NBDC](https://humandbs.biosciencedbc.jp/en/data-submission). In principle, the two points of "[Before submitting your data"](#before) " must be fulfilled, and the informed consent documents must explain that the human data are deposited to database and are shared publicly.  

\*2 Personal identification code is defined in the [guideline (Japanese only)](//www.ppc.go.jp/) of the [Personal Information Protection Commission](//www.ppc.go.jp/en/).

However, please note the following points.

In case of citation for each sequence record  
: In general, it is enough to describe [accession number](/acc_def.html) (and its version, if necessary) in your publication.  
If you discuss about the data in detail, please use [primary citation](/ddbj/submission-e.html#pcite) for the data as a reference.

: In general, please use [original article for each service](/references-e.html) as a reference.

#### Copyright and limitation of using DDBJ data <a name="copyright"></a>

##### DDBJ data set is a collaborative work of tens of thousands of authors world wide

DDBJ data set is an accumulation of DNA records submitted to either DDBJ, GenBank and EMBL-Bank as a world wide collaborative effort called
INSDC (International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration).

Although DDBJ does not impose any control over the use of any part of the accumulated records, there have not been any copyright transfer from
authors of the records upon submission. This is the reason why we, DDBJ, avoid making any definite statement that anybody may freely copy/modify/redistribute any part of the data set.

Since 2002, we ask all submitting authors to read the following policy, according to [the advice from International Advisory Committee](/insdc-e.html#policy).

"The INSD will not attach statements to records that restrict access to the data, limit the use of information in these records, or prohibit certain types of publications based on these records. Specifically, no use restrictions or licensing requirements will be included in any sequence data records, and no restrictions or licensing fees will be placed on the redistribution or use of the database by any party."

We believe that by doing this we obtain, in effect, a permission equivalent to a waiver of copyright from authors. In fact, no author of the DDBJ records have claimed any restriction about the reuse of any part of the data set by the third parties until know.

Hence, DDBJ data set is a quasi-public domain data, which is made by the collaboration of the many and which can be reused freely.

## Patent, Intellectual Property and Priority<a name="ownership"></a> 

### Nucleotide Sequence Data Included in Patent Applications

Nucleotide sequence data included in patent applications are transferred from [Japan Patent Office](//www.jpo.go.jp/e/index.html) (JPO) to
DDBJ.  
Similarly, DDBJ services also include the nucleotide data transferred from [Korean Intellectual Property Office](//www.kipo.go.kr/) (KIPO)、[the European Patent Office](//www.epo.org/index.html) (EPO), [the United States Patent and Trademark Office](https://www.uspto.gov/) (USPTO) and [the Korean Intellectual Property Office](//www.kipo.go.kr/en/) (KIPO).

References:  
: An example of Sequence data included in patent applications: [DL000001](http://getentry.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/getentry/na/DL000001/?filetype=html)
: [Sequence data included in patent applications](/ddbj/pat-data-e.html)

Therefore, when the sequence is included in patent applications to
JPO/KIPO/EPO/USPTO, you do not have to submit the sequence to DDBJ.

### Notice: Sequence Data Submission Related to Patent Applications

Once released from DDBJ, the sequence data becomes part of the public domain, i.e. "official notice".  
So, when you submit the sequence related to your patent application to DDBJ, set [hold date](/ddbj/submission-e.html#holddate) as required.  
See also [Principle of “Hold-Until-Published” data release](/data-release-policy-e.html).

For the impact of DDBJ submission on the patent examination, you should directly confirm to the Patent Office that you applied.  
DDBJ takes no responsibility for any property or priority issues of the released data.

Since we have to keep the original sequence data from JPO, "as is", if you need to modify or to correct the sequence, you have to submit the sequence to DDBJ newly. i.e. Both old and new ones will be finally open to the public.

If you are to submit sequence data related to your patent application, you should [consult DDBJ](/contact-e.html) before submission.

### Patent Priority and Other Priority <a name="priority"></a>

#### Patent Priority

If you submit nucleotide sequence data to DDBJ, you get <span class="red">NO patent priority for the data</span>.  
DDBJ takes no responsibility for any property or priority issues for patenting.

If necessary, you should consult the patent office, before submitting your data to DDBJ.

#### Other Priority

Submitting your nucleotide sequence data to DDBJ, EMBL Bank or GenBank does not necessarily guarantee the priority of the data as shown in the
following examples.

  - Nomenclature of new species: See also [Organism Qualifier](/ddbj/organism-e.html)
  - Nomenclature of gene and protein: See also [Gene nomenclature at DDBJ](/ddbj/cds-e.html#product)
