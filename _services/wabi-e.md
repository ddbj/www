## WABI (Web API for Biology)

WABI is a web API for using the search services of the DNA Data Bank of
Japan (DDBJ) without needing to navigate the web front-end. Through the
web API, you can develop program code that can query the DDBJ search
service and obtain search results.

For example, the following shows the URI for searching BLAST based on
particular criteria, and the corresponding response received after
sending the URI as a GET HTTP request.

```

```

  - [getentry](/services/getentry-e.html#ge_program)
  - [ARSA](/services/arsa-e.html)
  - [ClustalW](/services/wabi-clustalw.html) (only available in Japanese)
  - [VecScreen](/services/wabi-vecscreen.html) (only available in Japanese)
  - [MAFFT](/services/wabi-mafft.html) (only available in Japanese)
