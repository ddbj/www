## About VecScreen  {#About_VecScreen}

VecScreen is a tool that can detect foreign DNAs such as vector, linker,
adapter, and primer regions (we call vector contamination in this
document) involved in nucleotide sequences (query) by using blast search
against vector sequence database. The main unit of this tool is
[vecscreen program obtainable from
NCBI](//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/vecscreen/univec/).


## Available Internet browsers  {#browser}

We confirmed that IE8 or newer, latest version of Firefox, Chrome, and
Safari can work correctly. If you use VecScreen by an older version of
Internet browser, you may meet some trouble for executing the search.



## How to use  {#usage}

[](#query "Query") [](#www "WWW or Email") [](#database "Databases")
[](#format "Output format") [](#execute "Execute")
[](#resultviewer "Result viewer")


### Query  {#query}

  - Please enter the query sequence(s) in FASTA format. Please put query
    sequence(s) on the text box or upload the query sequence(s) through
    "File Upload".
  - When query consist of multiple sequences, you need to add each
    sequence name by using ">" (right angle bracket) to the line just
    before each sequence (multi FASTA format, see example below).
  - When you investigate a single sequence, you do not have to add a
    name to the sequence, however, if you would like to assign a name to
    the query, you should describe the name with ">" (right angle
    bracket) before the first line of the sequence.

<div class="attention" markdown="1">
When the query sequence size is too big (a large number of sequences, or
each sequence is very long), the result might not be displayed on the
web screen normally because of the following reasons.

  - Internet browser cannot display the result because of vastness of
    result size.
  - VecScreen terminate abnormally because of lacks of memory.
  - Timeout occurs because of a long time for analysis.

In such a case, you should reduce number of nucleotide sequences or
shorten the sequence length and retry the search.
</div>



### WWW or Email  {#www}

When "WWW" is selected, the result is interactively displayed on the
screen. If you would like to obtain the result by an email, please
select "E-mail" and enter your email address correctly. WWW is selected
by default.



### Databases  {#database}

Please select a vector database either UniVec or UniVec_Core. UniVec is
selected in the default. The system uses the same database that can be
obtained from <https://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/UniVec/>.

UniVec  
: UniVec is a non-redundant vector database consists of many vector,
linker, adapter, and primer sequences. When UniVec is selected,
users must remove false positive hit from the result by their manual
check. You should choose UniVec when you would like to obtain
maximum detection of vector contamination by allowing false positive
hit.

UniVec_Core  
: UniVec_Core is a subset of UniVec database. UniVec_Core is
designed so that the users can automatically detect vector
contamination without manually reviewing the result. It is expected
that the result involves minimum size of false positive hits.

UniVec_Core contains oligonucleotide and vector sequences from
bacteria, phage, yeast, and synthetic construct and does not involve
vector sequences such as mammalian-derived sequence. Therefore,
UniVec_Core is sometimes unable to detect vector contamination that
UniVec can do it.



### Output format  {#format}

Please select a type of result format. "HTML format, with alignment" is
set in the default.


HTML format, with alignment  
: Result is obtained in HTML format. Graphic viewer showing vector
contamination region on query, summary of the result, and alignment
are displayed(([example](/assets/images/help/VecScreen-HTMLwAlign.png)).

HTML format, no alignment  
: Result is obtained in HTML format. Graphic viewer showing vector
contamination region on query and summary of the result are
displayed([example](/assets/images/help/VecScreen-HTMLwoAlign.png)).

Text list, with alignment  
: Result is obtained in TEXT format. Summary of the result and
alignment are
displayed([example](/assets/images/help/VecScreen-TEXTwAlign.png)).

Text list, no alignment  
: Result is obtained in TEXT format. Summary of the result is only
displayed([example](/assets/images/help/VecScreen-TEXTwoAlign.png)).

### There is no parameter settings  {#There_is_no_parameter_settings}

VecScreen does not have option for blastn parameters. The tool executes
vecscreeen program that is obtained from NCBI. For details, please refer
the links below.  
[//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/vecscreen/about/](//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/vecscreen/about/)  
[//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/vecscreen/univec/](//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/vecscreen/univec/)

### Execution (Send to VecScreen)  {#execute}

Vector contamination check starts when you click "Send to vecscreen".
When you click "Clear" query sequence(s) is erased.

### Result screen  {#result}

According the scores and e-value, the result are displayed with the
classification of three categories, **Strong match**, **Moderate
match**, and **Weak match**, which indicates the order of the
probability of vector contamination (**Strong** > **Moderate** >
**Weak**). The <50-bp region between the two vector hit position or the
region from vector hit position to the end are also detected as
**Suspect Origin** which suggests possible vector contamination. For
details, please refer to the URL below.
[//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/vecscreen/about/#Categories](//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/vecscreen/about/#Categories)

## Determination of the position of vector contamination  {#Determination_of_the_position_of_vector_contamination}

If you would like to carry out the detection of vector contamination
automatically, the regions that are indicated by **Strong match** and
**Moderate match** are usually taken as vector contamination. **Weak
match** shows a possibility of vector contamination and **Suspect
origin** also suggests the contamination. The two categories, **Weak
match** and **Suspect origin** doesn't always show the vector
contamination.

Strictly speaking, you should determine the correct position of the
vector contamination from the VecScreen results by taking into
consideration of vector, adapter, linker, primer sequences used by
cloning experiment and cloning method.

Please refer to the URL below for detailed explanation of the result.
[//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/vecscreen/interpretation/](//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/vecscreen/interpretation/)



## Notes when the result is not correct

VecScreen is not a perfect tool that can detect entire vector
contamination. When query sequences that are not covered with UniVec
database were used, it is expected that the VecScreen cannot detect at
all. Or VecScreen may underestimate vector contamination region or
predict the results as lower categories even though VecScreen can detect
a similar sequences from UniVec. You should carry out vector trimming
with consideration of foreign DNA and method that are actually used for
the cloning experiment.

## Request ID  {#requestid}

{: .float-left }
After pressing the "Send to VecScreen" button, Request ID is displayed
on the screen. The same ID is also shown at the top of the result
screen. Do not forget the ID because it is necessary for using the
"Result Viewer" and/or inquiring to DDBJ for your search. You can view
your result using "Request ID" at any time until the cutoff date even if
the browser is closed.
