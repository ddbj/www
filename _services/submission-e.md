## Before Nucleotide Sequence Submission

### Purpose and Significance of Nucleotide Sequence Submission

In many scientific journals, it is required to assign and to describe
[INSDC accession number](/acc_def-e.html) for a nucleotide sequence on
the research paper. DDBJ is a member of [International Nucleotide
Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC)](http://www.insdc.org/).

When you wish to publicize your sequence through DDBJ, and your sequence
is [acceptable](/acc_def-e.html) for DDBJ, you can submit your sequence
to DDBJ, even if you have no plan to publication of any research paper
related to the sequence.

Once released, the nucleotide sequences submitted to INSDC including
DDBJ are [available for everyone](/insdc-e.html#policy).

If you submit nucleotide sequences to DDBJ, you can get [NO priority for
patent](/policies-e.html#priority).


### New Submission or Update?

When you wonder your sequence data should be newly submitted or your
previous entry should be modified, do not hesitate to contact us at
[Contact form](/ddbj/updt-form-e.html) "Data updates / Corrections".

[Nucleotide Sequence Submission System](/ddbj/websub-e.html) is a tool
only for new submission, so, do not use Nucleotide Sequence Submission
System to send your update request. If you need to modify your previous
entry, see [the link for update request](/ddbj/updt-e.html), and contact
us at [Application Form for Data Update
Requests](/ddbj/updt-form-e.html).


### Rights and Duties of Submitter<a name="right"></a>

For sequence submission to DDBJ, it is required for submitters to
provide not only nucleotide sequence but also address of [submitters and
contact person](#submitter), reference(s) (including [primary
citation](#pcite)), names of source organisms, function, natures of
genes, and so on (collectively means "**registration
information**" of the entry).

DDBJ releases its data in [the DDBJ flat file
format](/ddbj/flat-file-e.html). Submitter(s) and contact person of the
entry are indicated in the [REFERENCE
1](/ddbj/flat-file-e.html#Reference1) of DDBJ flat file, in principle

Following the progress of research, personnel change, and/or correction
of some error, [submitters of the entry can revise and/or
update](/ddbj/updt-e.html) their own nucleotide sequence and
registration information.

As mentioned above and [the page to explain dataflow](#data_flow), the
nucleotide sequences released from DDBJ are available for everyone. When
a user other than the submitter of the entry points out some error(s) in
the entry, DDBJ will inform it to contact person of the entry. Since
only submitters of the entry can revise and/or update the entry it depends on the submitters of the entry if the entry
is modified following user's claim or not.

Basically, it is required for the submitters to response user's inquiry
about their own entry. When you wish to contact to the submitter(s) of
an entry of your interest, please contact us through [the inquiry
form](/contact-e.html#to-submitter) with reasons briefly, then we will
forward your message to the submitter(s). So, [do not block E-mails from
DDBJ](/precautions-e.html).

When there is a disagreement between users and submitters on
registration information of an entry, DDBJ maintains neutrality for both
opinions.


### Releases of Primary Citation and Sequence Data

During preparation/submission of [primary citation](#pcite), DDBJ can
store your registration information privately in the meantime. If
necessary, submitters have to include a [hold
date](/ddbj/submission-e.html#holddate) in their registration
information. Then, the entry with a hold date is stored privately at
DDBJ. DDBJ must maintain registration information as confidential until
publication of the entry.

The hold data will be open to the public according to [principle of data
release](/data-release-policy.html).

In principle, [even submitters cannot remove their own
entry](/ddbj/updt-e.html#q9) if the entry has already been released
and/or the accession number is publicized in Journal etc.

However, DDBJ can suppress the entry in many of its services following
the submitter's request.

    Policies](/insdc-e.html#policy)


## Required items for nucleotide sequence submission

### Submitters

The items, affiliation, postal address and phone number of [contact
person](#contact) and all names of [submitters](#submitter) submitters
are required. Some of those items will be indicated in [REFERENCE
1](/ddbj/flat-file-e.html#Reference1) on the flat files of the entries.
After 2008, none of E-mail address, phone or fax number of the contact
person is displayed without disclosing request from submitters.

Notice: Submitter should not be only one person.  
: Submitter of the entry is the person who have responsibility to the
submitted data in the entry. We accept updating requests only from
the original submitter of the entry.  
Basically, we strongly recommend to describe joint submitters more
than two persons, e.g. at least a true worker and an adviser, to
avoid lost communication in future.  
In principle, we cannot accept any sequence data from a student
without whose advisers in names of submitter.


### Date of data release to the public

Submitters can select the status of their data, either "immediately
release" or "hold until published". "hold date" is the date to start the
distribution of the entry. Submitter can specify the date, if
necessary  
If you selected "hold until published", it is required to specify the
"hold date" of your data.  
Reference: [Principle of "Hold-Until-Published" data
release](/data-release-policy-e.html)


### Number of sequences

If you would like to have consecutive accession numbers, you should fix
the number of entries before your submission.

Even if your sequence is identical to previously reported sequence(s),
on the condition that the sequence is independently determined, you can
submit it as a "new" entry. Basically, DDBJ accepts all sequence data
that are independently determined, even though sequences are identical
each other.  
However, for variation studies, DDBJ also accepts submissions of
multiple identical sequences with frequency and total sample number.
DDBJ recommends to normalize research data for variation studies by
appropriate set of entries; basically, the number of entries should be
equal to multiplication of numbers of sequence polymorphisms and sampled
populations.  
See also [representative submissions of identical sequences for
variation studies](/ddbj/represent-e.html), in detail.


### Scientific paper, REFERENCE

You have to describe authors and title of the main paper for the
sequence, as a [primary citation](#pcite). Even though you have no plan
to submit any paper for you sequence, please enter authors and title,
formally.

You can describe just referred papers which does not describe about the
submitting sequence, if necessary.


### Biological knowledge related to nucleotide sequence

Whether the species is identified or not, it is required to describe the
relevant information on the biological origin of your sequence with
[organism name](/ddbj/organism-e.html) etc.

As annotation for your sequence, [feature](/ddbj/features-e.html) should
be described, if at all possible. You should describe features such as
[protein coding sequences (CDS)](/ddbj/cds-e.html),
[rRNA](/ddbj/features-e.html#rRNA), [tRNA](/ddbj/features-e.html#tRNA),
[ncRNA](/ddbj/features-e.html#ncRNA) and so on with their
[location](/ddbj/location-e.html). Please also describe qualifiers, such
as [product](/ddbj/qualifiers-e.html#product),
[gene](/ddbj/qualifiers-e.html#gene) and so on, arbitrarily.

Notice: protein coding sequence; CDS feature should have gene and product.  
: See also the guideline of [gene nomenclature at
DDBJ](/ddbj/cds-e.html#product) before your submission.


### Nucleotide sequences

You can use [IUPAC nucleotide base
codes](/ddbj/code-e.html#nucleotide-1) to describe your nucleotide
sequences.

In general, you have to exclude following sequences from your data,
except that you are to submit an artificially constructed sequence such
as expression vector, etc.

  - The sequence derived from a vector.
  - The sequence derived from a linker and/or an adapter.
  - The sequence derived from primer that is designed by referring from
    the highly conserved region of which the real sequence is unknown.

Before your submission, we strongly recommend you to screen your
sequences with our web
service;[VecScreen](http://ddbj.nig.ac.jp/vecscreen/?lang=en).


## Workflow of the data submission to DDBJ

### 1 Data Submission

(A) Nucleotide Sequence Submission System  
: DDBJ generally recommends you to use [Nucleotide Sequence Submission
System](/ddbj/websub-e.html).

(B) Mass Submission System (MSS)  
: We recommend the use of [Mass Submission System (MSS)](/ddbj/mss-e.html) if:
  - the submission consists of large number of sequences (entries);
    greater than 1024,
  - the submission involves long (greater than 500 kb) nucleotide
    sequences which result in a complex submission containing many
    features (greater than 30 in an entry) as in the case of genome
    data, or
  - the submission cannot be handled by Nucleotide Sequence
    Submission System.


### 2 Annotation

We annotate in accordance with our rules and the international rules
agreed upon by the DDBJ/ENA/GenBank consortium. In the annotation
process, we may contact the Contact Person to make inquiry about the
data.


### 3 Assignment and Notification of Accession Number

We inform an accession number (unique number assigned by the
International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration) to the Contact
Person whose E-mail address is entered in the "Contact person E-mail
address" field.  
This notification is normally sent within five business days after
receipt of the data.  
If you do not hear from us within this time period, please [contact
us](/contact-e.html#to-ddbj).


### 4 Report of Data Releasing

We notify data release to the Contact Person by E-mail. Once the data
are released, please confirm the data by one of the retrieval tools
accessible from the DDBJ homepage (e.g.,
[getentry](http://getentry.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/top-e.html)).

If you would like to update your data, please send a request mail from
[Application Form for Data Update Requests](/ddbj/updt-form-e.html) with
the necessary information. Please refer to
[Updates/Correction](/ddbj/updt-e.html) (after getting your accession
number) for details.
