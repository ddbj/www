TogoVar-repository is a public repository for submissions of human genetic variants, allele and genotype frequencies. TogoVar-repository accepts submissions of human genetic variations in two categories and issues accession numbers with distinct prefixes: short variants (&le;50 bp) and large structural variants (>50 bp).

* Short variants: variants &le;50 bp including single nucleotide variations, microsatellites, and small-scale insertions and deletions. Variations are exchanged with the NCBI [dbSNP](https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/).
* Large structural variants: variants >50 bp including insertions, deletions, duplications, inversions, mobile elements, translocations, and complex variants. Variations are exchanged with the NCBI [dbVar](https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dbvar/).

TogoVar-repository and dbSNP/dbVar only accept variations of human. [European Variation Archive](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/eva/) accepts variations of both human and non-human organisms.
