TogoVar-repository is a public repository for submissions of human genetic variants, allele and genotype frequencies. TogoVar-repository accepts submissions of human genetic variations in two categories and issues accession numbers with distinct prefixes: short variants (&le;50 bp) and large structural variants (>50 bp).

* Short variants: variants &le;50 bp such as SNVs/INDELs. Variations are exchanged with the NCBI [dbSNP](https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/).
* Large structural variants: variants >50 bp such as CNVs and chromosomal translocations. Variations are exchanged with the NCBI [dbVar](https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dbvar/).

TogoVar-repository and dbSNP/dbVar accept human submissions only. [European Variation Archive](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/eva/) accepts both human and non-human submissions.    
For this purpose, TogoVar-repository accepts human genetic variants and allele/genotype frequencies in two categories and issues accession numbers with distinct prefixes: short variants (â‰¦50 bp) such as SNVs and small-scale INDELs, and large structural variants (>50 bp) such as copy number variations and chromosomal translocations. Both categories are exchanged with dbSNP and dbVar at NCBI (2), respectively. As of August 2024, two new studies are publicly available via our FTP site (ftp://ftp.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/togovar).
