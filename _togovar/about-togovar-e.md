TogoVar-repository was launched in September 2024 as a public repository for human genetic variations. Public variation data are exchanged with the NCBI [dbSNP](https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/) and [dbVar](https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dbvar/). TogoVar-repository complements [TogoVar](https://grch38.togovar.org/) of the Database Center for Life Science (DBCLS), a service to catalog variants observed in Japanese populations with frequencies and annotations for variant interpretation.
