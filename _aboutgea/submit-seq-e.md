# Submit sequencing experiment

<div class="section book">

<div class="section chapter">

## GEA submission flow

<div id="flow">

<div class="step1">

### 1\. Obtain a submission account

  - Create a [D-way submission account](https://ddbj.nig.ac.jp/D-way/).
  - To enable GEA submission, [register a public key and a center name
    to your account](/account-e.html#enable-dra-submission-in-account).

</div>

<div class="step2">

### 2\. Register a BioProject, BioSamples and Sequence Read Archive (DRA)

BioProject and BioSample registration is required for DRA submission.

#### [BioProject](/bioproject/submission-e.html)

  - A description of the reseach effort.

#### [BioSample](/biosample/submission-e.html)

![](/images/parts/tsv.png)

  - A description of biologically or physically unique samples used to
    generate experimental data.

#### [DRA](/dra/submission-e.html)

![](/images/parts/tsv.png)

  - Raw sequencing reads and alignments.

![](/images/parts/tsv.png)metadata can be submitted as a tab-delimited
text file.

</div>

<div class="step3">

### 3\. Upload processed data files

  - Upload processed data files into the GEA submission directory.

</div>

<div class="step4">

### 4\. Select a DRA submission

  - Select a DRA submission which contains raw sequencing reads for the
    GEA submission.
  - Select DRA submissions when the GEA experiment has processed data
    from raw sequencing reads in multiple DRA submissions.

</div>

<div class="step5">

### 5\. Select a BioProject

  - Select a BioProject used in the DRA submission when the GEA
    experiment and DRA submission belong to same project.
  - Select a BioProject not used in the DRA submission when the GEA
    experiment and DRA submission belong to different projects.

</div>

<div class="step6">

### 6\. Prepare IDF and SDRF

#### IDF

  - The IDF (Investigation Description Format) file is used to give an
    overview of the experiment, including the experimental design,
    protocols and publication information.

#### SDRF

![](/images/parts/tsv.png)

  - The SDRF (Sample and Data Relationship Format) describes the sample
    characteristics and the relationship between samples, data files
    etc.
  - SDRF template is generated from selected BioProject, BioSample(s)
    and DRA submission(s). Enter additional information.

</div>

<div class="step7">

### 7\. Submit IDF and SDRF and validate data files

  - After submitting IDF and SDRF metadata in the submission web system,
    validation of the uploaded data files are automatically started.
  - The submission passed validation will be reviewed.

</div>

</div>

</div>

<div class="section chapter">

## Pre-submission checklist

<div class="sub_section">

#### [Single-cell sequencing experiment](javascript:void\(0\))

<div class="toggle_text box">

Refer to [ArrayExpress Single-cell submission
guide](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/help/single-cell_submission_guide.html).
Please [contact GEA team](/contact-e.html) to upload any additional
files for custom spike-ins or to facilitate data analysis.

</div>

</div>

<div class="sub_section">

#### [More than one technology per experiment](javascript:void\(0\))

<div class="toggle_text box">

GEA will ask you for the technology and name of the array, and applies
it to the whole submission. If you have used different types of
technologies for the same set of samples, we ask you to create separate
submissions. Please make sure that the submissions have distinct titles
(even though they may belong to the same study), in order to avoid
mistakes. If you have samples from more than one array design in your
experiment, it is possible to submit only one experiment. If you wish to
do this, please [contact GEA team](/contact-e.html).

## Sequencing experiment submission

<div class="section section">

### Create a new submission

Login [the D-way
(https://trace.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/D-way)](https://ddbj.nig.ac.jp/D-way/) and
the top page is displayed. Move to the GEA submission site from the
"GEA" menu at the top.

Create a new microarray experiment submission by selecting "Sequencing"
and clicking the \[New submission\]. At the same time, in the DDBJ file
server (ftp-private.ddbj.nig.ac.jp), a corresponding subdirectory is
created under the submitter’s GEA upload directory. [Upload data files
to this subdirectory](#upload-data).

If there is no reply from submitters after three months of initial
contact, submissions will be cancelled.

![Create a new submission](/images/books/seq-sub1.jpg

List of submission status is as follows. The GEA team reviews submission
whose status is in "submission\_validated" or "data\_error".

## Supplement: MD5

MD5 (Message Digest Algorithm 5) is a hash function which calculates a
hash value (MD5 number, 32-digit numbers and letters) of a given file.
Because the MD5 number of the damaged file is distinct from the original
one, we can check whether the transferred file is intact or not by
comparing the numbers before and after the file transfer.
