### “Hold-Until-Published” data release

In principle we release "Hold-Until-Published" data when one of the
following three conditions is met:

1. The [submitter](/ddbj/submission-e.html#submitter) requests to
release the data.
2. The [accession number](/documents/accessions-e.html) has published and it has
been confirmed.
  - We do not release the data when its accession number was published
    wrongly by other than the submitter.
  - "publish" means to disclose the accession number(s) to the public
    through paper (including on-line publication), thesis, academic
    meeting, internet, press report, etc..  
    "publish" also means cited accession numbers in published data
    including all of following cases: BioProject, BioSample and DRA
    accession numbers cited by [DBLINK line](/ddbj/con-e.html#Dblink) of
    DDBJ flat file, DDBJ accession numbers cited by [/inference
    qualifier](/ddbj/qualifiers-e.html#inference), [PRIMARY
    line](/ddbj/tsa-e.html#Primary) and [CONTIG
    line](/ddbj/con-e.html#Contig) of DDBJ flat file, BioProject and
    BioSample cited as DRA metadata.
3. A specified [hold-date](/ddbj/submission-e.html#holddate) has come.


<div class="attention" markdown="1">
  - In cases 2) and 3), data will be released without permission from
    the submitter.
  - Above three principles are applied to the data which were registered
    at DDBJ after January 1, 1998. For the data submitted before 1998,
    principles 1) and 2) are applied.

### Notes on “Hold-Until-Published” data release

Why is the hold-date required?  
: One of important policies for DDBJ is that the data submitted to
DDBJ should be eventually released and shared.  
So, DDBJ will release your data as soon as possible, if you like to
do so.  
However, in many cases, submitter needs to hold the data in the
meantime, mainly until publication of related academic paper.  
In that case, specification of hold-dated is required.  
The reason why DDBJ asks submitter to specify a hold-date is to
avoid that the submitted data is left without publication.  
If you wish your data to be held for a while at DDBJ, be sure to
specify the exact date (hopefully within one year) on which the
sequences should be released to the public.  
In the required time, please contact us to release your data or to
postpone its hold-date, after seeing Management of data release
schedule.

Management of data release schedule
: 
  - The data submitter has to manage schedule of data release by
    him/herself, in principle.
  - As mentioned in principle 1), when the submitter requests to
    release the data, DDBJ will do so even before the hold-date.
  - If you like to postpone the hold-date, please let us know
    accession number and its new hold-date at least two working days
    before the old hold-date.
  - Please note in advance that we will release the data which the
    specified hold-date will come during
    [holidays](/ddbj/submission-e.html#holiday) in order after the
    start of our work.
: If you want to release your data or [to postpone the hold-date of
your data](/ddbj/update-e.html), please contact us via [web form](/ddbj/update-form-e.html).  
See [Data Updates/Corrections](/ddbj/update-e.html) in detail.
