## The International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC)

{: .float-left }
[INSDC](http://www.insdc.org/ ) is a global collaboration of independent governmental or non-profit organisations 
that manage nucleotide sequence databases capturing and preserving nucleotide sequence information 
and annotations to create a comprehensive collection that preserves the scientific record 
and enables broad sharing of such data.    
[INSDC Members](#member) exchange data and make exchanged data freely accessible 
without restrictive licensing as part of the scientific record, including all corrections and updates.

## Governance

The INSDC is governed by two committees as detailed below:    


### EC; Executive Committee  {#ec} 

The Executive Committee establishes the strategic directions of INSDC, 
directs administrative activities such as organising meetings 
and overseeing the INSDC website content, resolves disputes, and sets membership expectations.    


### IC; Implementation Committee  {#ic} 

The INSDC Implementation Committee accepts INSDC-wide policies, protocols, and procedures; 
prepares for and responds to technology changes; 
approves modifications for infrastructure requirements, features, and schemas used 
to build INSDC-participating repositories and their services; 
 trains, assesses, and approves new INSDC Members; 
and maintains website content and internal documentation.    

See [INSDC meeting report](/activities/index-e.html?tag=insdc_meeting )



### Members and Participating Databases {#member}

The INSDC is a collaboration between the following member organisations and their databases:

## Mission and Vision

The mission of INSDC is to support advancements in biomedical and life sciences, public health, 
research, innovation, discovery, education, capacity building, and bioeconomies by providing services 
to accept, preserve, and openly disseminate sequence data and metadata that are generated worldwide.    

INSDC is the premiere open access nucleotide sequence data sharing collaboration in the world, 
fostering access of nucleotide sequence data from all continents and regions, 
and providing broad recognition to those who generate and share sequence data.    

The INSDC mission and vision builds upon the previous INSDC policies as follows.    


### Nucleotide Sequence Database Policies  {#policy} 

See also [INSDC site](https://www.insdc.org/policy/ ) and [Science 298 (5597): 1333 15 Nov 2002](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.298.5597.1333b ):    

: The INSD has a uniform policy of free and unrestricted access to all the data records their databases contain.  
Scientists worldwide can access these records to plan experiments or publish any analysis or critique.  
Appropriate credit is given by citing the original submission, following the practices of scientists utilizing published scientific literature.  

: The INSD will not attach statements to records that restrict access to the data, limit the use of the information in these records, 
or prohibit certain types of publications based on these records.  
Specifically, no use restrictions or licensing requirements will be included in any sequence data records, and no restrictions or
licensing fees will be placed on the redistribution or use of the database by any party.  

: All database records submitted to the INSD will remain an entry accessible as part of the scientific record.  
Corrections of errors and update of the records by authors are welcome and erroneous records may be removed from the next database release, 
but all will remain permanently accessible by accession number.  

: Submitters are advised that the information displayed on the web sites maintained by the INSD is fully disclosed to the public.  
It is the responsibility of the submitters to ascertain that they have the right to submit the data.  

: Beyond limited editorial control and some internal integrity checks (for example, proper use of INSD formats 
and translation of coding regions specified in CDS entries are verified), 
the quality and accuracy of the record are the responsibility of the submitting author, not of the database.  
The databases will work with submitters and users of the database to achieve the best quality resource possible.

The INSD is an outstanding example of success in building an immensely valuable, widely used public resource 
through voluntary ooperation across the international scientific community.  
This success has been achieved following the guidelines and principles outlined above.
