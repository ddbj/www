DDBJ Center collects nucleotide sequence data as a member of [INSDC(International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration)](http://www.insdc.org/) and provides freely available nucleotide sequence data and supercomputer system, to support researchã€€activities in life science.


## Mission  {#mission}

It is generally accepted that research in biology today requires both
computer and experimental equipment equally well. Information achieved
from enormous exhaustive data have greatly contributed to the paradigm
shift in biology. Biology or life sciences are no longer restricted to
wet-bench experiments. In silico and in vitro / in vivo analyses
together will push back the frontiers of life sciences. In particular,
researchers in life science must rely on computers to analyze nucleotide
sequence data accumulating at a remarkably rapid rate. Actually, this
triggered the birth and development of information biology. DDBJ Center
is to play a major role in carrying out research in information biology
and to run DDBJ operation in the world.

The principal purpose of DDBJ operations is to improve the quality of
INSD, as public domains. When researchers make their data open to the
public through INSD and [commonly shared in world
wide](/policies-e.html#copyright), we at DDBJ Center make efforts to
describe information on the data as rich as possible, according to the
unified rules of INSD, preferably without any stress by using DDBJ.

Nucleotide sequence records organismic evolution more directly than
other biological materials and thus is invaluable not only for research
in life sciences but also human welfare in general. The database is, so
to speak, a common treasure of human beings. With this in mind, we make
the database online accessible to anyone in the world.



## Governing Structure  {#governing}

Currently, DDBJ Center is in operation at [Research Organization of
Information and System National Institute of
Genetics(NIG)](https://www.nig.ac.jp/nig/) in Mishima, Japan with
endorsement of [MEXT; Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports,
Science and Technology](http://www.mext.go.jp/en/).

DDBJ Center is reviewed and advised by its own advisory board, DNA
Database Advisory Committee (an outside committee of NIG), and also by
the advisory board to INSDC, [International Advisory
Committee](/about/insdc-e.html#iac).

## Major Activities  {#activity}


### Construction and Operation of INSDC  {#insd}

In Japan, DDBJ Center internationally contributes as a member of
[INSDC](/about/insdc-e.html) to collect and to provide nucleotide sequence
data with [ENA](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena)/[EBI](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/)
in Europe and [NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) in USA.

DDBJ Center is officially certified to collect nucleotide sequences from
researchers and to issue [the internationally recognized accession
number](/documents/accessions-e.html) to data submitters. The accession number issued
for each sequence data is unique on the database and internationally
recognized to guarantee the submitter the property of the submitted and
published data. Since DDBJ Center exchanges the released data with
ENA/EBI and NCBI on a daily basis, the three data centers share
virtually the same data at any given time. The virtually unified
database is called INSD; International Nucleotide Sequence Database.  
DDBJ collects sequence data mainly from Japanese researchers, but of
course accepts data and issue the accession numbers to researchers in
any other countries. 99% of INSD data from Japanese researchers are
submitted through DDBJ.

#### Providing nucleotide and amino acid sequence data related to patent applications  {#pat}

[INSD](/about/insdc.html#insd) contains nucleotide sequence data related to
patent applications collected by Patent Offices in Japan, Korea, Europe
and USA.  
DDBJ Center also provides amino acid sequence data related to patent
applications collected by patent offices in Japan and Korea. See
following links in detail.  

Refer to:

  - [Sequence data included in patent
    applications](/ddbj/patent-data-e.html)
  - [Patent, Intellectual Property and
    Priority](/policies-e.html#ownership)
  - [Patent column from DDBJ](/activities/patent-e.html)



### Management and operation of the National Institute of Genetics Supercomputer System  {#supercom}

[The National Institute of Genetics Supercomputer
System](https://sc.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/en) (NIG Supercomputer) is a
large-scale computer utilization site with genome analysis as its
primary focus. The system provides Supercomputing System Services
comprising leading-edge, large-scale cluster-type computers, large-scale
memory-sharing computers, and high-capacity, high-speed disk devices.


### Providing services to search and to analyze biological data  {#Providing_services_to_search_and_to_analyze_biological_data}

#### Biological database management: tools for depositing and retrieving  {#Biological_database_management__tools_for_depositing_and_retrieving}

We provide databases maintained by DDBJ and others through [web
services](/services/) or on NIG Supercomputer.  
You can collectively download databases from [our FTP
site](/services/).

#### Providing software tools for analyzing biological   {#Providing_software_tools_for_analyzing_biological_data}

We provide software tools for data analyses developed by DDBJ and others
through [web services](/services-e.html) or on NIG Supercomputer.



### Training course and publication  {#Training_course_and_publication}

DDBJ holds a training course for bioinformatics,
[DDBJing](/activities/index.html) (in Japanese), to teach how to submit
nucleotide sequence data and how to use our services for analyzing life
science data.

We announce [the latest information for DDBJ
activities](/news/en/index-e.html).
