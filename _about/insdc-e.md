DDBJ Center has been closely collaborating with [EBI; European
Bioinformatics Institute](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/)/ [ENA; European
Nucleotide Archive](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/) in Europe and [NCBI;
National Center for Biotechnology
Information](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) in USA to construct INSD;
International Nucleotide Sequence Database through exchanging data and
information on internet and by regularly holding two meetings,[IAC; the
International Advisory Committee](#iac) and [ICM; the International
Collaborative Meeting](#icm).  
The operations of DDBJ, ENA/EBI, NCBI and ICM subscribe to [advice from
IAC](#policy).

## Collaboration framework to construct International Nucleotide Sequence Database  {#insd}

{: .float-left }
From the beginning, 1980s, DDBJ has been functioning as one of the international nucleotide sequence databases, including
EMBL-Bank/[EBI](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/) in Europe and
[GenBank](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Genbank/index.html)/[NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/)
in the USA as the two other members.<br>
In 2005, DDBJ, EMBL-Bank and GenBank agreed to call their collaboration 
**[INSDC; International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration](http://www.insdc.org/)**; and to call the unified nucleotide sequence database 
**INSD; International Nucleotide Sequence Database**.The agreement was approved by IAC in May 2005.<br>
In 2009, INSDC added a coraborative meeting to deal with mass sequence data produced by the "next" generation sequencers (Sequence Read Archive) and traces produced by traditional gel/capillary sequencers (Trace Archive).
In 2010, databases at EBI were integrated to [ENA; European Nucleotide Archive](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/).

## IAC; International Advisory Committee  {#iac} 

International Advisory Committee consists of nine members, each of 3
members selected from Europe, US, or Japan.The committee meeting to
advice in fairness to maintenance and future plan of INSDC is held once
a year.

## ICM; International Collaborative Meeting  {#icm} 

[International Collaborative Meeting](/activities/index-e.html)
consists of working-level participants of INSDC and its fundamental
principle is international collaboration. The meeting to discuss
practical matters to maintain and update INSDC is held once a year.

## Overview of International Nucleotide Sequence Databases Policies  {#policy} 

This brief policy statement, prepared by the International Advisory
Committee to the International Nucleotide Sequence Databases (INSD;
DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank), describes the procedures followed by the INSD.

These policies are unanimously recommended by the INSD advisors.

Individuals submitting data to the international sequence databases managed collaboratively by DDBJ, EMBL, and GenBank should be aware of the following:  
: The INSD has a uniform policy of free and unrestricted access to all
the data records their databases contain. Scientists worldwide can
access these records to plan experiments or publish any analysis or
critique.Appropriate credit is given by citing the original
submission, following the practices of scientists utilizing
published scientific literature.

: The INSD will not attach statements to records that restrict access
to the data, limit the use of the information in these records, or
prohibit certain types of publications based on these records.
Specifically, no use restrictions or licensing requirements will be
included in any sequence data records, and no restrictions or
licensing fees will be placed on the redistribution or use of the
database by any party.

: All database records submitted to the INSD will remain an entry
accessible as part of the scientific record. Corrections of errors
and update of the records by authors are welcome and erroneous
records may be removed from the next database release, but all will
remain permanently accessible by accession number.

: Submitters are advised that the information displayed on the web
sites maintained by the INSD is fully disclosed to the public. It is
the responsibility of the submitters to ascertain that they have the
right to submit the data.

: Beyond limited editorial control and some internal integrity checks
(for example, proper use of INSD formats and translation of coding
regions specified in CDS entries are verified), the quality and
accuracy of the record are the responsibility of the submitting
author, not of the database. The databases will work with submitters
and users of the database to achieve the best quality resource
possible.

The INSD is an outstanding example of success in building an immensely
valuable, widely used public resource through voluntary ooperation
across the international scientific community. This success has been
achieved following the guidelines and principles outlined above.
