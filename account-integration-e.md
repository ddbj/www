## Current account system <a name="current-account"></a>

Bioinformation and DDBJ Center provides three separate account systems,
BioProject/BioSample/DRA/GEA (D-way), JGA and AGD. These systems will be
integrated into new single system with ['group' concept](group-e.html)
and users will be able to access all submission services with single
account. In the new system, a principal investigator (PI) and a
researcher can collaboratively submit and update records within their
own accounts, and transfer records to a successor when leaving institute
or lab.

## Integration to the D-way account<a name="migration"></a>

As the first step, the JGA account system will be integrated to the D-way in 29th September, 2020. At the same time, the D-way account will be introduced to the application system of <a href="https://humandbs.biosciencedbc.jp/en">NBDC</a>. After this integration, users will be able to "apply data submission application to NBDC - submit data to JGA" and "apply data use application to NBDC - download JGA dataset" in the same D-way account.

The JGA account migration process is explained below.

### When you own JGA account only <a name="jga-only"></a>

If you have JGA account (Account: 'A') only, 'A' is migrated to the D-way. After the integration, in the D-way account, you can use BioProject/BioSample/DRA/GEA as well as JGA/NBDC application systems. If 'A' already exists in the D-way, an new D-way account ID different from that of JGA is created.

<span class="red">After a new account is notified, do NOT
create new D-way account to avoid duplication.</span>

### When you own D-way account only <a name="dway-only"></a>

When you own D-way account (Account: 'B') only, after the JGA system is integrated to D-way, you can use 'B' in BioProject/BioSample/DRA/GEA as well as JGA/NBDC application systems.

### When you own both JGA and D-way accounts <a name="jga-and-dway"></a>

When you own a JGA (Account: 'C') and a D-way account (Account: 'D'). 
<span class="attention_text">The JGA accounts are merged to the D-way accounts.</span>
After the integration, you can use 'D' for BioProject/BioSample/DRA/GEA as well as JGA/NBDC application systems. The JGA data linked to 'C' are transferred to 'D'. The account 'C' will be discontinued.

## AGD account <a name="agd-account"></a>

The AGD account will be integrated to D-way as JGA (planned in 2020).
