# Submission to AGD

<div class="section book">

<div class="section chapter">

## Submission Guide

The AGD accepts only de-identified data approved by NBDC. The users
apply for data submission directly to the
[NBDC](http://gr-sharingdbs.biosciencedbc.jp/agd-guidelines) and the AGD
will only accept submissions once the information of a successful
application process has been passed from the NBDC to the AGD.

Following internal IDs are issued to metadata objects with prefixes.

<div id="id" class="main_table">

| Prefix | Metadata object | Digit | Example           |
| ------ | --------------- | ----- | ----------------- |
| AGD\_  | Submission      | 11    | AGD\_00000000001  |
| AGDS\_ | Study           | 11    | AGDS\_00000000001 |
| AGDN\_ | Sample          | 11    | AGDN\_00000000001 |
| AGDX\_ | Experiment      | 11    | AGDX\_00000000001 |

</div>

</div>

<div class="section chapter">

## Sequence data file (raw/unaligned and aligned)

Supported AGD data submission formats are described below. If you have
data in any other format or have any questions please [contact the
AGD](/contact-e.html).

Data files should be de-multiplexed prior to submission so that each
data object is submitted with files containing data for a single sample
only.

<div class="section section">

### BAM format

Binary Alignment/Map files (BAM) represent one of the preferred AGD
submission formats. BAM is a compressed version of the Sequence
Alignment/Map (SAM) format (see
[SAMv1.pdf](https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/SAMv1.pdf)). BAM files
can be decompressed to a human-readable text format (SAM) using
SAM/BAM-specific utilities (e.g. [samtools](http://www.htslib.org/)) and
can contain unaligned sequences as well.  
AGD strongly recommends to submit BAM including unaligned reads as
primary data into Data.

The BAM files are nearly optimal in terms of compression and should be
submitted uncompressed.

</div>

<div class="section section">

### Fastq format

Primary sequence data submissions of single and paired reads are
accepted as [Fastq](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTQ_format#Quality)
files that meet the following the requirements:

<div class="sub_index">

  - Quality scores must be in
    [Phred](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phred_quality_score) scale. For
    example, quality scores from early Solexa pipelines must be
    converted to use this scale. Both ASCII and space delimitered
    decimal encoding of quality scores are supported. We will
    automatically detect the Phred quality offset of either 33 or 64.
  - No technical reads (adapters, linkers, barcodes) are allowed.
  - Single reads must be submitted using a single Fastq file.
  - Paired reads must split and submitted using two Fastq files. The
    read names must have a suffix identifying the first and second read
    from the pair, for example '/1' and '/2'; (regular expression for
    the reads "^(.\*)(\[\\\\.|:|/|\_\])(\[12\])$").
  - The first line for each read must start with '@'.
  - The base calls and quality scores must be separated by a line
    starting with '+'.
  - The Fastq files must be compressed using gzip or bzip2.

</div>

Example of Fastq file containing single reads:

``` code
@read_name
GATTTGGGGTTCAAAGCAGTATCGATCAAATAGTAAATCCATTTGTTCAACTCACAGTTT
+
!''*((((***+))%%%++)(%%%%).1***-+*''))**55CCF>>>>>>CCCCCCC65
...
```

Example of Fastq file containing paired reads:

``` code
@read_name/1
GATTTGGGGTTCAAAGCAGTATCGATCAAATAGTAAATCCATTTGTTCAACTCACAGTTT
+
!''*((((***+))%%%++)(%%%%).1***-+*''))**55CCF>>>>>>CCCCCCC65
@read_name/2
GATTTGGGGTTCAAAGCAGTATCGATCAAATAGTAAATCCATTTGTTCAACTCACAGTTT
+
!''*((((***+))%%%++)(%%%%).1***-+*''))**55CCF>>>>>>CCCCCCC65
...
```

</div>

<div class="section section">

### SFF format

The recommended submission format for the 454 platform is SFF.

The SFF files are nearly optimal in terms of compression and should be
submitted uncompressed.

</div>

</div>

<div class="section chapter">

## Array based (Genotypes, SNP, Expression)

The AGD accepts processed data from all types of array based
technologies, such as genotypes, gene expression, methylations, etc.

We are very flexible regarding these submissions and would accept all
types of files affiliated to the array experiment into the AGD array.

We recommend that both raw data (CELs) and analysis files be submitted,
which will enable potential users of the data to recreate your results
cited in the paper as well as view the described results.

The AGD also archives any sample-associated phenotype information.

</div>

<div class="section chapter">

## Variation data file

The AGD supports submissions of sequence variations in [VCF
format](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variant_Call_Format). The vcf files
are accepted as secondary analysis object.

</div>

<div class="section chapter">

## Other data files

Analysis can refer to multiple Data and Sample objects and summary data
summarizing data files of these objects can be registered to the
Analysis. Example analysis files are listed below.

<div class="sub_index">

  - A reference sequence GFF3 file assembled by using multiple sequence
    files in a objects.
  - A table file summarizes normalized array data files in Arrays.
  - A phenotype table file summarizes phenotype information of Samples.

</div>

</div>

<div class="section chapter">

## Metadata

The AGD data model is created by extending the [Sequence Read Archive's
model](/dra/submission-e.html). The AGD metadata are composed of the XML
objects.

AGD XML schema: [AGD
xsd](https://github.com/ddbj/pub/tree/master/docs/jga)

![Example: single policy.](/images/submission/jga_metadata_1.jpg)

![Example: separate policies for control and
case.](/images/submission/jga_metadata_2.jpg)

<div class="section">

### Summary information for public display

When AGD submissions are released, following metadata objects will be
public on the AGD and NBDC websites to display summary of submissions.

  - Submission:  
    All fields excluding submitters' contact information.
  - Study:  
    All fields.
  - Data set:  
    All fields, number of samples, and filesize.
  - Policy:  
    All fields.

</div>

<div class="section">

### Submission

The submission XML is used to describe the submission transaction. It
contains contact details of the submitter.

XML schema:
[AGD.submission.xsd](https://github.com/ddbj/pub/tree/master/docs/jga)

</div>

<div class="section">

### Study

The study XML describes your study in detail. It contains a title, a
study type and an abstract, as it would appear in the publication. After
publication, the study can be updated to include the PubMed ID of the
paper containing the submitted data.

XML schema:
[AGD.study.xsd](https://github.com/ddbj/pub/tree/master/docs/jga)

</div>

<div class="section">

### Sample

The sample XML describes each of the samples used in your submission. A
sample generally corresponds to a participant. Whilst the mandatory
fields are minimal we highly recommend to describe the sample in as much
detail as possible.

XML schema:
[AGD.sample.xsd](https://github.com/ddbj/pub/tree/master/docs/jga)

</div>

<div class="section">

### Experiment

The experiment XML is used to describe each unique set of experimental
setup details. This includes the library preparation details, sequencing
and microarray platforms. The experiment XML can represent both
sequencing and array experiments.

XML schema:
[AGD.experiment.xsd](https://github.com/ddbj/pub/tree/master/docs/jga)

</div>

<div class="section">

### Data

The data XML describes the data files and their relationship with the
experiments. The data XML serves as a file container.

XML schema:
[AGD.data.xsd](https://github.com/ddbj/pub/tree/master/docs/jga)

</div>

<div class="section">

### Analysis

The Analysis XML can be used to submit analyzed and summarized data to
JGA. Sample phenotype files can also be submitted. Variation data can be
submitted as VCF files. Only one VCF file can be submitted in each
analysis and the samples used within the VCF files must be associated
with JGA Samples. Optimally the VCF file would be associated with an
INSDC reference assembly and sequences either by using accessions or by
using commonly used labels.

XML schema:
[AGD.analysis.xsd](https://github.com/ddbj/pub/tree/master/docs/jga)

</div>

<div class="section">

### Data set

The dataset XML describes the data files, defined by the Data XML and
Analysis XML, that make up the dataset and links the collection of data
files to a specified Policy (Data Access Agreement). Submitters do not
need to create data set when single policy is associated with all data
files. Please consider the number of datasets that your submission
consists of, for example, a case control study is likely to consist of
at least two datasets.

In general, policy is determined by informed consent with participants.

XML schema:
[AGD.dataset.xsd](https://github.com/ddbj/pub/tree/master/docs/jga)

</div>

<div class="section">

### Policy

The Policy XML describes the Data Access Agreement (DAA).

XML schema:
[AGD.policy.xsd](https://github.com/ddbj/pub/tree/master/docs/jga)

</div>

</div>

<div class="section chapter">

## Analysis only submission

To submitting only aggregated data or data which are not suitable for
Sample-Experiment-Data, these data can be submitted as Sample-Analysis
instead of Sample-Experiment-Data.
