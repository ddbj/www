## 2014 <a name="2014"></a>

### 27th ICM: May 20-22 2014, Mishima, Japan

[International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration
(INSDC)](http://www.insdc.org/), consisted of DDBJ,
[EBI](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/) and [NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/),
hold the international collaborators meeting every year.  
In 2014, the meeting was [held at DDBJ](/news/en/wn140520-e.html), 20-22
May, to discuss practical matters to maintain and update nucleotide
sequence data archives; [DDBJ](/index-e.html),
[ENA](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/),
[GenBank](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/index.html), Sequence
Read Archive (SRA) and Trace Archive.  
The outcomes of the meeting are summarized below.

#### The Items; Discussed and To Be Studied

BioSample database  
:  The BioSample database contains descriptions of biological source materials used in experimental assays.  
  DDBJ has also started accepting [BioSample](/biosample/index-e.html) submissions in early 2014.  
  Following the meetings on [2012](/activities/icm/2012-e) and [2013](/activities/icm/2013-e), we discussed action items to collect and to share BioSample data at INSDC.

Issues about lots of genome submissions, [WGS](/ddbj/wgs-e.html) and so on  
Data Exchange  
:  We discussed new data formats and an effective way to exchange data each
  other.

[Assembly](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/) (Genomic Collection)  
:  Following the meeting on [2012](/activities/icm/2012-e), we continues collaboration with Assembly activities to collect genome sequences.

About /[protein\_id](/ddbj/qualifiers-e.html#protein_id)  
:  Currently, we have so many submissions of similar genomes derived from multiple strains of a species etc. In those cases, there are many orthologs in CDS features, so, many /protein\_ids seem to be redundantly assigned for them. We discussed possibilities about new ways of /protein\_id assignment.

#### Changes in SRA XML schema

SRA XML schema version 2.0 continues to be discussed for refactoring SRA metadata with [BioProject](/bioproject/index-e.html) and [BioSample](/biosample/index-e.html) data.

#### Forthcoming changes in The DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank Feature Table: Definition <a name="2014-ft"></a>

The following items will be applied from October 2014 with the next revision of [Feature Table Definition](/ddbj/feature-table-e.html), if not otherwise specified.

-   A new feature, [regulatory](/ddbj/features-e.html#regulatory), and a
    new qualifier,
    /[regulatory\_class](/ddbj/qualifiers-e.html#regulatory_class), will
    be available from December 2014.  
    Following features will be replaced by the new feature; -35\_signal,
    -10\_signal, CAAT\_signal, GC\_signal, TATA\_signal, polyA\_signal,
    attenuator, terminator, promoter, enhancer, RBS.
-   A base code for 'dihydrouridine' of [Modified Base
    Abbreviations](/ddbj/code-e.html#nucleotide-2) and
    /[mod\_base](/ddbj/qualifiers-e.html#mod_base) qualifier, "d" will
    be replaced by "dhu".
-   To be sure using
    [prim\_transcript](/ddbj/feature-table-e.html#prim_transcript) and
    [precursor\_RNA](/ddbj/feature-table-e.html#precursor_RNA) for RNA
    transcripts other than mRNA, their definitions will be updated
    appropriately.
-   [Since 2013](?page=2013), a new qualifier, /type\_material, is
    considered to specify type strains, type specimens and so on.  
    It is not decided in details and applicable period of the qualifier.
