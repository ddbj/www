### 30th ICM: May 24-26 2017, Mishima, Japan

[International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration
(INSDC)](http://www.insdc.org/), consisted of DDBJ,
[EBI](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/) and [NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/),
hold the international collaborators meeting every year  
In 2017, the meeting was held at DDBJ, 24-26 May, to discuss practical
matters to maintain and update nucleotide sequence data archives;
[DDBJ](/index-e.html), [ENA](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/),
[GenBank](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/index.html), Sequence
Read Archive (SRA) and Trace Archive.  
We also hold [a symposium](/files/pdf/30th/NIG_and_DDBJ_Symposium-e.pdf)
commemorating the 30th anniversary.  
The outcomes of the meeting are summarized below.

#### The Items; Discussed and To Be Studied

Changes for organism names  
Unidentified bacteria or fungi  
:  In cases of sequence submissions derived from unidentified bacteria or fungi, we mainly requested to describe organism names (/organism qualifier) in the format, "\[genus name\] sp. \[ID\]" (e.g. "Acetobacter sp. ITDI2.1"). For the future submissions, describe in the simple format, "\[genus name\] sp." (e.g. "Acetobacter sp.").   In this regard, however, for whole genomes or proposing new species, describe organism names in the format, "\[genus name\] sp. \[ID\]", ongoingly.  
  See also [here](/ddbj/organism-e.html#unidentified) in detail.

Influenza viruses  
:  In cases of sequence submissions derived from influenza viruses, we requested to describe virus names (/organism qualifiers) in the format, "Influenza \[A/B/C/D\] virus (\[strain name\](\[serotype\]))" (e.g. "Influenza A virus (A/chicken/Tokyo/2007(H7N7))").After January 2018, we accept them as "Influenza \[A/B/C/D\] virus" (e.g. "Influenza A virus").  
  See also [here](/ddbj/organism-e.html#virus) in detail.

Targeted Locus Study (TLS) data  
:  Since [2016](/activities/icm-reports-e.html#2016), INSDC has started to accept [TLS](/ddbj/tls-e.html) data.   After discussion about some practical issues at the meeting, DDBJ will start accepting TLS data submission.

Targets of SRA storage  
:  We confirmed each other the ways to accept data accompanied with read sequences, such as BioNano mapping data, methylation, antibiogram and so on.

INSDC annotation  
:  We will start discussion to sort out relationship between annotation using features/qualifiers in INSDC and general format using [Sequence Ontology](http://www.sequenceontology.org/)/[GFF3](https://github.com/The-Sequence-Ontology/Specifications/blob/master/gff3.md).

[Assembly](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/) (Genome Collection)  
:  To enhance the collaboration with Assembly since [2012](/activities/icm-reports-e.html#2012), we discussed some practical issues.  Related to this, we confirmed that we should caution during sequence submissions when the sizes of genome sequences were deviated from the closely related species.

#### Forthcoming Changes in The DDBJ/ENA/GenBank Feature Table: Definition <a name="2017-ft"></a>

The following items were proposed to be applied for [Feature Table
Definition](/ddbj/full_index-e.html) from the next revision.

-   A new qualifier for [source](/ddbj/features.html#source) feature,
    [/submitter\_seqid](/ddbj/qualifiers-e.html#submitter_seqid) will be
    available.
-   Addition of two controlled vocabularies, "scaRNA" and "pre\_miRNA",
    for [/ncRNA\_class](/ddbj/qualifiers-e.html#ncRNA_class) qualifier.
-   Addition of a controlled vocabulary, "contamination", for
    [/gap\_type](/ddbj/qualifiers-e.html#gap_type) qualifier.
-   Addition of some controlled vocabularies for
    [/type\_material](/ddbj/full_index-e.html#type_material) qualifier.
