## 2012  <a name="2012"></a>

### 25th ICM: June 11-13 2012, Bethesda, USA

[International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration
(INSDC)](http://www.insdc.org/), consisted of DDBJ,
[EBI](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/) and [NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/),
hold the international collaborators meeting every year.  
In 2012, the meeting was held at NCBI in USA, 11-13 June, to discuss
practical matters to maintain and update nucleotide sequence data
archives; [DDBJ](/index-e.html),
[EMBL-Bank](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/embl/),
[GenBank](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/index.html), Sequence
Read Archive (SRA) and Trace Archive  
The outcomes of the meeting are summarized below.

#### The Items; Discussed and To Be Studied

BioSample database  
:  The BioSample database contains descriptions of biological source materials used in experimental assays. The purpose of the BioSample database is to provide unified storage and access to information about biological samples. These samples may have investigation information stored in other databases (e.g. nucleotide sequence, expression).
:  Both EBI and NCBI have already been independently collecting [BioSample at NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/biosample) and [BioSamples at EBI](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biosamples/). Including DDBJ, we discussed how to collect and share BioSample data collaboratively as an INSDC activity.
:  The format of BioSample accession number is SAM\[D\|E\|N\]+ 8 digits; e.g. D=DDBJ; E=EBI; N=NCBI;  
for example: SAMD01234567

Strain level taxonomy ID assignment for microorganism genome submission  
:  All [organism names](/ddbj/organism-e.html) that are represented in the sequence data of INSDC are registered to the taxonomy database.
:  [Since 2009](/activities/icm/2009-e), taxonomy database has considered to terminate assignment of strain level taxonomy ID for microorganism genomes.
:  However, taxonomy database agreed not to stop assigning strain-level taxonomy IDs for prokaryotic strains with sequenced genomes until at least 2013. The change to the current practice will not be made until BioSamples has reached maturity and sample content is exchanged, and so the change may not take place until later in 2013 or beyond.

Genome scale submissions  
:  Both submitters and users require INSDC to collect genome data varied in samples and study goals.
:  Especially in bulk (re)sequenced cases, INSDC should ask data providers to submit at least one set of assembled/annotated reference genome data, to accept only raw reads to SRA for other genomes with BAM, VCF, GFF in analysis object; i.e. without draft assembles of WGS and scaffold CON data.
:  While, in cases of genomes sequenced/assembled to finished level, i.e. possibly treated as a reference genome, INSDC should not label 'complete genome' in [KEYWORDS](/ddbj/flat-file-e.html#Keywords) for genome data without feature annotation. We should support submitters to annotate their sequences by providing tools and help documents for the minimal standards/requirements
:  NCBI introduced one of its activities, [Assembly](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/assembly/) (Genome Collection) database. The Genome Collection database has information about the structure of assembled genomes as represented in an AGP file or as a collection of completely sequenced chromosomes. INSDC agreed to collaborate with this activity.

#### Changes related to INSDC submission

Termination of accepting new submission of MGA data  
:  Since 2004, we have accepted the submission of [MGA data](/ddbj/mga-e.html). However, along with the popularization of new sequencing platforms, this data model seemed to be out of date. So, we decided to terminate accepting new submission of MGA data. For new submissions, please conact to [DDBJ Sequence Read Archive (DRA)](/dra/index-e.html) and [DDBJ Omics Archive (DOR)](/gea/index-e.html).

#### Changes in SRA XML schema

[SRA XML schema version
1.4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/viewvc/v1/trunk/sra/doc/SRA_1-4/) has
already been applied for SRA data since July 2012.

SRA XML schema version 1.5 will be applied in the near future. The
modification points would be elimination and consolidation of redundant
description items.

SRA SRA XML schema version 2.0 continues to be discussed for refactoring
SRA metadata with [BioProject](/bioproject/index-e.html) and
[BioSample](/biosample/index-e.html)

#### Forthcoming changes in The DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank Feature Table: Definition  <a name="2012-ft"></a>

The following items will be applied from October 2012 with the revision
of [Feature Table Definition](/ddbj/feature-table-e.html), if not otherwise
specified.

-   Value format of /[anticodon](/ddbj/qualifiers-e.html#anticodon)
    qualifier will be modified to include its sequence.

-   A new value, "pcr", will be legal for
    /[linkage\_evidence](/ddbj/qualifiers-e.html#linkage_evidence)

-   The /[frequency](/ddbj/qualifiers-e.html#frequency) qualifier will
    be no more legal for [source](/ddbj/features-e.html#source) feature.

-   A new /[altitude](/ddbj/qualifiers-e.html#altitude) qualifier will
    be legal for [source](/ddbj/features-e.html#source) feature.

-   The controlled vocabularies for qualifier values will be reposited
    on [INSDC web site](http://www.insdc.org/) to revise them more
    frequent than every 6 months, revision of [Feature Table
    Definition](/ddbj/feature-table-e.html).

-   Since controlled values of
    /[mobile\_element\_type](/ddbj/qualifiers-e.html#mobile_element_type)
    qualifier are not systematic and could not well cover some
    instances, INSDC will discuss to improve the controlled values. It
    will be revised in 2013.

-   To represent nonfunctional genes,
    /[pseudo](/ddbj/qualifiers-e.html#pseudo) qualifier will be legal
    again.  
    In [ICM2011](/activities/icm/2011-e), INSDC adopted the
    new qualifier /[pseudogene](/ddbj/qualifiers-e.html#pseudogene) and
    deprecated the older /[pseudo](/ddbj/qualifiers-e.html#pseudo). The
    use of the /[pseudogene](/ddbj/qualifiers-e.html#pseudogene)
    qualifier indicates that the feature is a pseudogene of the type
    listed in the value.

    However, researchers still need to represent nonfunctional genes
    that are not formally described as pseudogenes. So, INSDC concluded
    to continue using /[pseudo](/ddbj/qualifiers-e.html#pseudo)
    qualifier in parallel to
    /[pseudogene](/ddbj/qualifiers-e.html#pseudogene) qualifier would
    allow this.
