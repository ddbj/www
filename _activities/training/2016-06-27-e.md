"DDBJ Data Analysis Challenge" is a machine learning competition using
"'International Nucleotide Sequence Database' data", which is one of the
life science big data provided by DDBJ. Participants need to submit
their generated machine learning models to a collaborative website,
[UnivOfBigData](http://universityofbigdata.net/?lang=en). Even college
students and/or researchers outside of life science field, can get an
opportunity of studying "Machine Learning and Data Mining", through this
Challenge. And, to join this Challenge more easily, DDBJ provides [NIG
Supercomputer System](https://sc.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/en) as your computer
resources.

### Challenge Task  {#task-2016}

DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ) supports a big data resource called by
[DDBJ Sequence Read Archive (DDBJ SRA)](/dra/index-e.html), which contains
DNA sequences genearated from high-throughput DNA sequencers. The
secondary analytical database, ChIP-Atlas database (Dr.Oki of Kyushu
Univ.) provides the annotation data of chromatin feature regions on
genome sequences.

At this challenge task, please predict whether genomic regions
corresponding to input DNA sequences includes chromatin feature regions.
Chromatin feature region is related to on-off function of gene
expression, and corresponds to peak regions on a genome sequence of the
ChIP-Atlas database.

Challenge's target species is a plant. The number of conditions for the
target plant is often over 100. The number of conditions in the
challenge is reduced and composed of eight conditions for saving time of
try and error on data modelling.

\------------------------------------  
Input training data: 60,000 DNA sequence  
Input test data: 10,000 DNA sequence  
Output training data: 8 conditions correct answer sets  
\-------------------------------------

\[Input\]  
One input sequence is composed of 200 bases, that is a ACGT sequence
fragment with 200 length,  
where the sequence is encoded as 01 code \[Example: AATGC ... =
10001000000100100100 ...\] so that  
the length of a sequence is 800 digits.  
Corresponding code: A = 1000, C = 0100, G = 0010, T = 0001, Other
exceptions = 0000

\[Output\]  
Output correct answer sets of 8 conditions is also encoded as 01 code.  
True answer is one, which means that the input DNA sequence contains
chromatin feature regions.  
Likewise zero is false answer so that it does not include the chromatin
feature region.

\[Subject\]  
On the submit stage, please submit the probability of true prediction
with 10,000 rows (test axis) and 8 columns (condition axis) in BigData
University website.
