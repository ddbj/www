## 1. Patent data distribution for Japan Patent Office (JPO)  <a name="1"></a>

### 1. Introduction

In this column, I would like to introduce about patent data exchange in
the [International Nucleotide Sequence Databases
(INSD)](http://www.insdc.org/) and Japan Patent Office (JPO) data.

### 2. Data distribution from INSD

DDBJ is constructing INSD with EMBL-Bank in EBI (European Bioinformatics
Institute) and GenBank in NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology
Information).  
INSD distributes not only scientific data but also patent data
transferring from each patent office as follows.

  - Japan： [Japan patent office (JPO)](//www.jpo.go.jp/e/index.html) →
    DDBJ
  - South Korea： [Korean Intellectual Property Office
    (KIPO)](//www.kipo.go.kr/kpo/user.tdf?a=user.main.MainApp) → DDBJ
  - USA： [United States Patent and Trademark Office
    (USPTO)](//www.uspto.gov/) → GenBank
  - Europe： [European Patent Office (EPO)](//www.epo.org/) → EMBL-Bank

Patent data contains nucleotide sequence and amino acid sequence. After
distributed nucleotide sequence data, it was exchanged among INSD.
However, INSD does not exchanged amino acid data.  
DDBJ distributes JPO and KIPO amino acid data on DDBJ anonymous FTP
site.

[DDBJ anonymous FTP](https://ddbj.nig.ac.jp/public/ddbj_database/patent/):  
JPO file: jpo_ddbj_aa\*.seq.gz (\*=file number)  
KIPO file: kipo_ddbj_aa.seq.gz

### 3. Patent data summary for JPO

#### 3-1) JPO data

DDBJ distributes nucleotide sequence and amino acid data containing
publication of unexamined patent applications. Therefore, new
distribution sequences do not have the patent right. When you would like
to confirm the progression status of patent examination, you need
checking the registration status using by retrieval site for (Industrial
Property Digital Library) in Japan.

#### 3-2) Kinds of JPO patent data and distribution frequency

DDBJ receives three kind of patent data from JPO;

  1. Publication of patent applications
  2. International application published under the Patent Cooperation
    Treaty (PCT)
  3. Japanese translations of PCT international publication for patent
    applications

DDBJ distributes the regular data at once a month and infrequently
irregular data in some cases.

#### 3-3) Patent data contents

JPO data of DDBJ flat file (FF) has enough information such as the front
page of patent publication by the following contents; sequence, organism
name, invention title, applicant name(s), inventor name(s), publication
number, publication date, application number, application date, priority
date, comment and sequence's feature information.

Example:
[DL000001](http://getentry.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/getentry/na/DL000001/?filetype=html:)

#### 3-4) Patent applied sequence submission to DDBJ

If you have sequence(s) for patent application, you do not have to
submit to DDBJ. Because JPO transfers those sequences to DDBJ and your
sequence(s) will be opened to the public through DDBJ. However, if you
need the accession number to submit a paper before apply for a patent,
you should care since sequence becomes public knowledge in case of
released from DDBJ. In this case, please confirm to JPO before your
submission.

### 4. Author comments

I hope to help understanding about JPO patent data. I will introduce
about KIPO data and retrieval method of patent sequence in KIPO related
organization at next column.

## 2. Patent data distribution for Korean Intellectual Property Office (KIPO)  <a name="2"></a>

### 1. Introduction

[In previous column](/activities/patent-e.html#1), I introduced about patent
data for Japan Patent Office (JPO). In this column, I would like to
introduce about patent data of Korean Intellectual Property Office
(KIPO) and data search service in DDBJ.  
DDBJ has just distributed some of KIPO data. Therefore, I would like to
introduce also search service of patent applied sequence at Korean
Bioinformation Center (KOBIC) and Korea Intellectual Property Rights
Information Service (KIPRIS) as KIPO related organization.

### 2. Summary of KIPO data

DDBJ has provided the nucleotide sequence and amino acid sequence
containing publication of unexamined patent applications from KIPO since
March 2008.

KIPO data is transferred to DDBJ as follows;

  1. KIPO sends the patent sequence data to KOBIC.
  2. By cooperation of Dr. Byungwook Lee in KOBIC, KIPO submission files
    are made by him and transferred from KOBIC to DDBJ.
  3. DDBJ exchanges the data format and distributes KIPO data.

DDBJ distributed the following 282,161 entries assigned the prefix "DI"
of KIPO accession number, until now.  
KIPO data submission is suspended by the problem of submission format
from April 2009. Therefore DDBJ is discussing about efficient method for
data exchange with KOBIC and KIPO.

Nucleotide sequence data : DI000001 - DI168562 (168,562 entries)  
Amino acid sequence data : DI500001 - DI613599 (113,599 entries)

Please see Data example of Fig.1 and Fig.2.

### 3. Data search for KIPO data

#### DDBJ

DDBJ provides the search service for KIPO nucleotide and amino acid
sequence (Table.1).

#### Korean Bioinformation Center (KOBIC)

PATOME@Korea is Koran patent database for nucleotide and amino acid
sequence in KOBIC. "PatSeq DB search" can search by application number,
applicant name, invention title in English. In addition, PATOME@Korea
provides the similarity search for DNA and protein against patent
applied sequences in Korea (Please see Fig.3).
  


{% include image.html url="ddbj/2_Fig3.png" caption="Fig.3, Top page of PATOME@Korea;" class="w630" %}



#### Korea Intellectual Property Rights Information Service (KIPRIS)

KIPRIS is the search system of Korean patent publication. PATOME@Korea
can search the patent publication in Korean. In contrast, KPA (Korean
Patent Abstracts) search of KIPRIS can refer the front page and abstract
of patent publication in English retrieved by keyword, application
number, publication number, applicant name and inventor name (Please see
Fig.4). K2E-PAT (Korean to English Patent Automatic Translation) has pay
service for the provision of full text by English machine translation.
  

{% include image.html url="ddbj/2_Fig4.png" caption="Fig.4, \"KPA\" search page of KIPRIS;" class="w630" %}



  
### Author comments

KIPO suspends their submission to DDBJ. We will restart KIPO submission
as soon as possible.  
At next column, I will introduce about the structure of DDBJ Flat Files
(FF) for JPO patent data.

## 3. Flat File structure for Japan Patent Office (JPO) -First part-  <a name="3"></a>

### 1. Introduction

I introduced about patent data of Japan Patent Office (JPO) in [first
column](/activities/patent-e.html#1) and Korean Intellectual Property Office
(KIPO) in [second column](/activities/patent-e.html#2). In this time, I
would like to explain about Flat File (FF) structure for JPO nucleotide
and amino acid sequence data as two parts. I will introduce about JPO
data property, summary of FF structure and relationship between patent
application contents and description part on FF in first part.

### 2. Property of JPO data FF

JPO data FF has fundamental application information of patent
publication compared with FF for United States Patent and Trademark
Office (USPTO) and European Patent Office (EPO). Because JPO makes the
submission file (Fig. 1) containing application information based on
WIPO (World Intellectual Property Organization) ST 25 format submitted
from applicants. Thereafter, DDBJ makes FF reflected almost contents of
JPO submission file (Fig. 2).

  

{% include image.html url="ddbj/3_Fig1.jpg" caption="Fig.1 Example of JPO submission file" class="w500" %}



### 3. FF structure and description contents

I showed FF structure for nucleotide sequence data dividing by six parts
(LOCUS Block, SOURCE Block, REFERENCE Block, COMMENT Block, Feature
Block and Sequence Block) as different color with sample data and
description contents in Fig. 2.


{% include image.html url="ddbj/3_Fig2.jpg" caption="Fig. 2 Correspondence relation of JPO nucleotide sequence data" class="w500" %}


Each Block name of symbol alphabet is as follows;  
[A] LOCUS Block, [B] SOURCE Block, [C] REFERENCE Block, [D]
COMMENT Block, [E] Feature Block, [F] Sequence Block

### 4. Patent application contents on FF

I showed correspondence relationship between patent application contents
and description parts on JPO FF (Table. 1).

### Author comments

In this time, Patent column is final. When you would like to know FF
structure and patent data property for JPO and KIPO data, please refer
to my columns. If I have a chance, I will explain how to search the
patent data by DDBJ tools and improvement points of JPO and KIPO FF.

## 5. New COMMENT format for Japan Patent Office (JPO) data  <a name="5"></a>

### 1. Introduction

DDBJ makes an improvement of COMMENT Block on Flat File (FF) for Japan
Patent Office (JPO). In this column, I would like to introduce new
format of COMMENT Block in detail.

DDBJ re-constructed FF of all JPO entries to reflect new COMMENT format.
New format of Nucleotide sequence data has been released since DDBJ
release 90 (Fig.1) and Amino acid sequence data has been distributed JPO
cumulated files on Anonymous FTP since September 2012 (Fig.2).


<div class="float-left" markdown="1">


{% include image.html url="ddbj/5_Fig1.jpg" caption="Fig.1 New format of COMMENT Block for Nucleotide sequence data" class="w320" %}


</div>


<div class="float-right" markdown="1">


{% include image.html url="ddbj/5_Fig2.jpg" caption="Fig.2 New format of COMMENT Block for Amino acid sequence data" class="w320" %}


</div>

{: .float-release}
### 2. New format of COMMENT Block

JPO data has almost basic information for patent application. Therefore,
user can get its information without referring patent publication.  
However, since patent information was set on different part of FF, user
had to know the FF structure to get them in advance. In specially,
applicants name is only set JOURNAL line on REFERENCE Block (Fig.3 &
Fig.4).


{% include image.html url="ddbj/5_Fig3.jpg" caption="Fig.3 Applicant name on REFERENCE Block" class="w500" %}



Therefore, DDBJ made describing basic patent information on COMMENT
Block as follows (Fig.4).


{% include image.html url="ddbj/5_Fig4.jpg" caption="Fig.4 Description of each line on REFERENCE [A] and COMMENT Block [B]" class="w500" %}



COMMENT Block was added new lines of PA (Applicant name), PT (Invention
title) and PS (Sequence number) in all nucleotide and amino acid
sequence data (Table.1).

| hNew line nameh | Description |
|---|
| **PA line** | Applicant name<br />JOURNAL line on REFERENCE Block is also described (Fig.3). |
| **PT line** | Invention title<br />DEFINITION, TITLE line on REFERENCE Block are also described (Fig.1 &amp; Fig.2). |
| **PS line** | Sequence number<br />Sequence number for Sequence listings setting after prefix letter "N". |

Table.1 New lines of COMMENT Block
{: .tablecaption}

### 3. Sequence number

#### 3-1:

There was mismatch problem of Sequence number between Sequence listings
and JPO submission file. Old format FF was not described Sequence number
of Sequence listings. Therefore, DDBJ added PS line on COMMENT Block to
set its number.

#### 3-2:

When applicants applied patent, they made Sequence listings according to
the guideline: WIPO ST.25. It was put ordering number from 1 to
nucleotide and amino acid sequences based on patent claims by
applicants.  
On the other hand, JPO changes sequence order and makes nucleotide
sequence block and amino acid sequence block from Sequence listings when
they make the submission files to DDBJ. After that, they set new
Sequence number in order of nucleotide sequences, amino acid sequences
(Table.2).

  

{% include image.html url="ddbj/5_Table2.jpg" caption="Table.2 Correspondence of Sequence number between Sequence listings and FF" class="w500" %}


  
#### 3-3:

Sequence number indicated by JPO is reflected with patent publication
number on DEFINITION, KEYWORDS, JOURNAL line of REFERENCE and PN line of
COMMENT Block.  
Publication of patent applications and Japanese translations of Patent
Cooperation Treaty (PCT) international publication for patent
applications have same format of publication number with "JP". PCT
international publication for patent application has "WO" in head of
publication number (Fig.1, Fig.2 and Table.3).
