## 35th ICM: May 23-27 2022, teleconference

[International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC)](http://www.insdc.org/ ), 
consisted of DDBJ Center, [EBI](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ ) and [NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ ),
hold the international collaborators meeting every year.    
In 2022, the meeting was to be held at NCBI. However, because of the influence of COVID-19, 
the meeting was held 23-27 May on a teleconference, 
to discuss practical matters to maintain and update nucleotide sequence data archives; 
[DDBJ](/index-e.html), [ENA](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/ ), [GenBank](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/index.html ),
Sequence Read Archive (SRA), BioProject and BioSample.    
The outcomes of the meeting are summarized below.

### The Items Discussed and To Be Studied

#### For the INSDC operation
-   [The status document](https://www.insdc.org/submitting-standards/insdc-status-document/ ) was revised. 
-   We discussed the challenges that will arise when migrating data to the cloud in the future.    
    The strategies would be required non-reliance on a specific vendor, data kept at two or more sites, and so on.  
-   The design of [the INSDC site](https://www.insdc.org/ ) is improved. 

#### SARS-CoV-2 Sequence Data Sharing  
We consider that sharing sequence data related to SARS-CoV-2 is one of the most important task for INSDC.    
We discussed some technical issues to accept SARS-CoV-2 sequences.    
Continuing discussions in [2020](/activities/insdc_meeting/2020-e.html) and [2021](/activities/insdc_meeting/2021-e.html), we are encouraging the scientific communities to submit their SARS-CoV-2 sequences to INSDC databases.    
We strongly recommend submitters of viral data provide following items
-   [/isolate](/ddbj/qualifiers-e.html#isolate) qualifier with the identifier [in the recommended format](/ddbj/identifiers-e.html#virus ) by [the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses](https://ictv.global/ )    
    See [The species Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus: classifying 2019-nCoV and naming it SARS-CoV-2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-020-0695-z )
-   [/host](/ddbj/qualifiers-e.html#host) qualifier
-   [/collection_date](/ddbj/qualifiers-e.html#collection_date) qualifier
-   [/country](/ddbj/qualifiers-e.html#country) qualifier

#### Verification for large scale data
NCBI introduced the following tools:
-   [Foreign Contamination Screen (FCS)](https://github.com/ncbi/fcs/wiki/ )
-   [Human read removal tool (HRRT)](https://github.com/ncbi/sra-human-scrubber )
-   [SRA SARS-CoV-2 Detection Tool](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/docs/sra-detection-tool/ )

### Forthcoming Changes in The DDBJ/ENA/GenBank Feature Table Definition  <a name="2022-ft"></a>

-   Two new [controlled vocabularies](https://www.insdc.org/submitting-standards/controlled-vocabulary-typematerial-qualifer/ ) for [/type_material](/ddbj/feature-table-e.html#type_material) qualifier will be introduced, "not verified as type" and "not considered type", that are not so usually used.  
-   By the end of 2022, we are planning to require that all new submissions include [/country](/ddbj/qualifiers-e.html#country) and [/collection_date](/ddbj/qualifiers-e.html#collection_date) qualifiers for each entry.    
    We are investigating operational issues for that.
