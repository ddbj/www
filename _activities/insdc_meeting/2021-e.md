## 34th INSDC meeting report: May 10-14 2021, teleconference

[International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC)](http://www.insdc.org/), 
consisted of DDBJ Center, [EBI](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/) and [NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/),
hold the international meeting every year.    
In 2021, the meeting was to be held at NCBI. However, because of the influence of COVID-19, 
the meeting was held 10-14 May on a teleconference, 
to discuss practical matters to maintain and update nucleotide sequence data archives; 
[DDBJ](/index-e.html), [ENA](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/), [GenBank](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/index.html),
Sequence Read Archive (SRA), BioProject and BioSample.    
The outcomes of the meeting are summarized below.

### The Items Discussed and To Be Studied

#### SARS-CoV-2 Sequence Data Sharing  
We consider that sharing sequence data related to SARS-CoV-2 is one of the most important task for INSDC.    
We discussed some technical issues to accept SARS-CoV-2 sequences.    
Continuing from [2020](/activities/insdc_meeting/2021-e.html), we are encouraging the scientific communities to submit their SARS-CoV-2 sequences to INSDC databases.    
See [a statement](http://www.insdc.org/sites/insdc.org/files/documents/INSDC_Statement_on_SARS-CoV-2_sequence_data_sharing_during_COVID-19.pdf).    
    
#### Changing [TPA](/ddbj/tpa-e.html) data format 
For future submissions, we will stop outputting PRIMARYlines for TPA data.    
To cite SRA data, we continue to use [DBLINK](/ddbj/flat-file-e.html#DBLINK) and we will use [COMMENT](/ddbj/flat-file-e.html#COMMENT) to cite others, if necessary.    
    

### Forthcoming Changes in The DDBJ/ENA/GenBank Feature Table Definition  <a name="2021-ft"></a>

-   For future submissions, we will no longer use /citation or /compare qualifiers.  
    Instead, use [/inference](/ddbj/qualifiers-e.html#inference) qualifier.  
-   The format of [/lat_lon](/ddbj/qualifiers-e.html#lat_lon) qualifier will be extended to include 8 decimal places.  
-   The terms, "recombination_enhancer" and "uORF" will be added to controlled vocabularies for [/regulatory_class](/ddbj/qualifiers-e.html#regulatory_class) qualifier.    

The modifications will be applied after October 2021 with the next revision of [Feature Table Definition](/ddbj/feature-table-e.html).
