## 33rd ICM: June 1-5 2020, teleconference

[International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC)](https://www.insdc.org/), 
consisted of DDBJ Center,
[EBI](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/) and [NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/),
hold the international collaborators meeting every year.  
In 2020, the meeting was to be held at DDBJ. However, because of the
influence of COVID-19, the meeting was held 1-5 June on a
teleconference, to discuss practical matters to maintain and update
nucleotide sequence data archives;
[DDBJ](/index-e.html), [ENA](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/), [GenBank](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/index.html),
Sequence Read Archive (SRA), BioProject and BioSample.  
The outcomes of the meeting are summarized below.

### The Items Discussed and To Be Studied

SARS-CoV-2 Sequence Data Sharing  
:  We consider that sharing sequence data related to SARS-CoV-2 is one of
  the most important task for INSDC. On the other hand, related to the
  matter of the Conference of the Parties Convention on Biological
  Diversity 14 and the Nagoya Protocol discussed in [2018](/activities/insdc_meeting/2018-e.html), the
  World Health Organization suggests researchers share sequence data of
  SARS-CoV-2 through [GISAID](https://www.gisaid.org/).  
  INSDC have joined together to issue [a
  statement](http://www.insdc.org/sites/insdc.org/files/documents/INSDC_Statement_on_SARS-CoV-2_sequence_data_sharing_during_COVID-19.pdf)
  encouraging the scientific community to submit their SARS-CoV-2
  sequences to INSDC databases.

### Discussion Items Related to SRA Data  <a name="2020-sra"></a>

New File Formats for SRA Data and Use of Cloud Resources at NCBI  
: As discussed in [2019](/activities/insdc_meeting/2019-e.html), NCBI is shifting SRA data into public
  cloud resources. Related to this issue, [SRA ETL-BQS](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/docs/sra-data-formats/), new
  file format for SRA data without base quality score, is proposed.

      provision by 17th July](/news/en/2020-06-10-e.html)

      Archive Data](https://datascience.nih.gov/sra-rfi-submission)

### Forthcoming Changes in The DDBJ/ENA/GenBank Feature Table Definition  <a name="2020-ft"></a>

-   A new qualifier,
    [/circular_RNA](/ddbj/qualifiers-e.html#circular_RNA) will be
    available for [CDS](/ddbj/features-e.html#cds), and
    [mRNA](/ddbj/features-e.html#mRNA) and
    [tRNA](/ddbj/features-e.html#tRNA) features.
-   The term, "circRNA", will be added to controlled vocabularies for
    [/ncRNA_class](/ddbj/qualifiers-e.html#ncRNA_class) qualifier.
-   Definitions of [/organism](/ddbj/qualifiers-e.html#organism) and
    [/country](/ddbj/qualifiers-e.html#country) qualifiers will be
    slightly changed. There is no change in the usage of these
    qualifiers.

The modifications will be applied after October 2020 with the next
revision of [Feature Table Definition](/ddbj/feature-table-e.html).
