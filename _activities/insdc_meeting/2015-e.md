## 2015 <a name="2015"></a>

## 28th ICM: May 19-21 2015, Bethesda, USA

[International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration
(INSDC)](https://www.insdc.org/), consisted of DDBJ,
[EBI](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/) and [NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/),
hold the international collaborators meeting every year.  
In 2015, the meeting was held at NCBI, 19-21 May, to discuss practical
matters to maintain and update nucleotide sequence data archives;
[DDBJ](/index-e.html), [ENA](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/),
[GenBank](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/index.html), 
Sequence Read Archive (SRA) and Trace Archive.  
The outcomes of the meeting are summarized below.

### The Items; Discussed and To Be Studied

Handling Human Data  
:   Following kind introduction of recent activities at [NIH](https://www.nih.gov/); 
    [HeLa access](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-14-080.html), 
    [Genomic Data Sharing (GDS)](https://osp.od.nih.gov/scientific-sharing/genomic-data-sharing/) policy, 
    [data analysis on cloud computing](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-15-086.html) and so on, 
    we discussed how to treat data submissions derived from human subjects at each databank.

INSDC Data Status  
:   We discussed practical procedures about data exchange among databanks, especially, 
    [INSDC status](https://www.insdc.org/submitting-standards/insdc-status-document/), replaced data between databanks and suppressed data of SRA.  

[Assembly](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/) (Genome Collection)  
:  To enhance the collaboration with Assembly since [2012](/activities/insdc_meeting/2012-e.html), we discussed some practical issues.

Rapid Growth of SRA Data  
:  To accommodate rapid increase of SRA data, NCBI and EBI introduced their frameworks of data compression; cSRA ([compressed SRA](https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/doc/csra-fileformat.ppsx)) and [CRAM](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/software/cram-toolkit), respectively.   We discussed how to apply lossy/lossless compression appropriately.

Misidentification of Species of Microorganism Genomes  
:  Following an academic paper, [Federhen S (2015)](https://nar.oxfordjournals.org/content/43/D1/D1086), and 
   [GenBank microbial genomic taxonomy workshop (12-13 May 2015)](https://standardsingenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40793-016-0134-1), 
   we discussed how to resolve the problem of misidentified genomes.

### Forthcoming changes in The DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank Feature Table: Definition  <a name="2015-ft"></a>

The following items will be applied from October 2015 with the next
revision of [Feature Table Definition](/ddbj/feature-table-e.html), if not otherwise specified.

-   The definition of [unsure](/ddbj/features-e.html#unsure) feature 
    will be updated to distinguish clearly from sequencing gap.  
-   We are discussing to add some terms for controlled vocabulary of 
    /[rpt_type](/ddbj/qualifiers-e.html#rpt_type) qualifier.  
    Accompanied with this modification, LTR feature will be merged into 
    [repeat_region](/ddbj/features-e.html#repeat_region) feature.  
-   [Since 2013](/activities/insdc_meeting/2013-e.html), a new qualifier, 
    /type_material, is considered to specify type strains, type
    specimens and so on.  
    It is not decided in details and officially applicable period of the qualifier at DDBJ.
