## 38th INSDC meeting report: June 10-12 2025, Cambridge, UK

[International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC)](/insdc/index-e.html ) hold the international meeting every year.    
In 2025, the meeting was held in 10-12 June at Cambridge to discuss issues to operate nucleotide sequence data archives.    
The outcomes of the meeting are summarized below.    

### Items under Consideration <a name="items"></a>

#### /transcript_id <a name="transcript_id"></a>

We are discussing the introduction of /transcript_id qualifier to indicate the relationship between [CDS](/ddbj/features-e.html#cds) and [mRNA](/ddbj/features-e.html#mrna) features.

### Revision of Feature and Qualifier Descriptions <a name="2025-ft"></a>

* Add "nitroplast" to the controlled values of [/organelle](/ddbj/qualifiers-e.html#organelle)  
* Add "domain architecture" and "ortholog evidence" to the controlled values of TYPE in [/inference](/ddbj/qualifiers-e.html#inference)  
* Deprecate [/variety](/ddbj/qualifiers-e.html#variety) and [/sub_species](/ddbj/qualifiers-e.html#sub_species), which partially overlap with organism names described in [/organism](/ddbj/qualifiers-e.html#organism)
