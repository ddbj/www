## D-way account  {#ddbj-submission-account}

Bioinformation and DDBJ Center provides the D-way account system. In the D-way account, you can use BioProject, BioSample, GEA, DRA and JGA databases of DDBJ Center and the DBCLS application systems. This handbook explains how to create and use a D-way account.

{::options parse_block_html="true" /}
<div class="attention">
- Create a D-way account and manage data with permission of Principal Investigator (PI).
- Issued account and password must be maintained securely by users.
- Account ID cannot be changed once it has been created.
- In the D-way account page, updated information will be reflected in about 10 minutes.
- It takes about 10 minutes for the created D-way account becoming active in the DBCLS application system.
</div>

DDBJ Center uses scp authenticated by a ssh key for transfer of large files. You need to register a public key to upload data files to DRA, GEA and JGA.

Users submitting data submission or data use applications to DBCLS are recommended to [enter additional account information](#dbcls). The added items are automatically filled to new applications and the users are able to avoid entering these items in each application.

## Create a D-way account in the website {#account-for-bioproject-biosample-submissions}

You need to register a [public key](#generate-key-pair) to upload files to DRA/GEA/JGA.
Please wait more than 10 minutes after entering account information, login [D-way](https://ddbj.nig.ac.jp/D-way) again and register a [public key](#generate-key-pair).

## Registering a public key {#public-key}

To upload data files to [DDBJ Sequence Read Archive (DRA)](/dra/index-e.html) and [Genomic Expression Archive (GEA)](/gea/index-e.html), a public key should be registered to your account. The public key is used to identify users to access the file submission server.

### Generate public and private key pair  {#generate-key-pair}

### Windows {#windows}

A public key for D-way authentification can be both openSSH and PuTTY formats.
For JGA data decryption, use openSSH-format private key. For WinSCP authentification, use PuTTY-format private key.

#### OpenSSH format {#openssh}

For JGA data decryption, use openSSH-format private key.

Run Windows PowerShell.

[![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/books/win-ps-1.jpg){:.w200}]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/books/win-ps-1.jpg "Run Windows PowerShell"){: .group1}

Execute following commands in the PowerShell window to generate openSSH-format key pair.

```
Generate key pair.
By default, for example, two keys will be generated at C:\Users\mtaro in the case of mtaro Windows user.
PS C:\Users\mtaro> ssh-keygen -t rsa

Message will be shown.
Generating public/private rsa key pair.

Press [Enter] for setting no passphrase.
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:

Your identification has been saved in id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in id_rsa.pub.

A private key is saved as "id_rsa" and a public key is saved as "id_rsa.pub" in "C:\Users\mtaro" folder.
```

Following is the example command execution in the PowerShell window.

[![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/books/win-ps-2.jpg){:.w600}]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/books/win-ps-2.jpg "Generate a key pair by PowerShell"){: .group1}

A private key is saved as "id_rsa" and a public key is saved as "id_rsa.pub" in the openSSH format under "C:\Users\mtaro" folder.
[![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/books/win-ps-3.jpg){:.w500}]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/books/win-ps-3.jpg "A openSSH key pair is generated under the user folder"){: .group1}

To distinguish the key pair, please save the JGA [public and private key pair for data decryption](/jga/download-e.html#key-for-decryption) as filenamaes having the applicatio ID by using -f option.
```
PS C:\Users\mtaro> ssh-keygen -t rsa -f J-DU999991
A private key is saved as "J-DU999991" and a public key is saved as "J-DU999991.pub" in "C:\Users\mtaro" folder.
```

#### PuTTY format {#putty}

Install and run the [PuTTY Key Generator](https://www.puttygen.com/%0A).
Set parameters as below and click the [Generate] button.

[![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/books/win_key_1.jpg){:.w400}]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/books/win_key_1.jpg "PuTTY Key Generator parameter settings"){: .group1}

Generate a key pair by moving mouse pointer randomly in the window and
save the public and private keys. The key is saved in the PuTTY format
and can be used in the WinSCP.

To distinguish the key pair, please save the JGA [public and private key pair for data decryption](/jga/download-e.html#key-for-decryption) as filenamaes having the applicatio ID.
For example, the public key "J-DU999991.pub" and the private key "J-DU999991".

### Mac OS X {#mac}

Run "Terminal" from Macintosh HD > Applications > Utilities >
Terminal.app.

[![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/books/mac_key_1_e.jpg){:.w400}]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/books/mac_key_1_e.jpg "Run Mac terminal"){: .group1}

In the Terminal, execute following commands.

```
Generate the keys.
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa

Messages are displayed.
Generating public/private rsa key pair.

File in which to save the key. Press [enter].
Enter file in which to save the key (/Users/you/.ssh/id_rsa):

Press the [enter] to set no passphrase.
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:

Your identification has been saved in /Users/you/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /Users/you/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
At "/Users/you/.ssh", the private key is saved as "id_rsa" and the public key is saved as "id_rsa.pub".
```

From the Finder "Go" menu, select the "Go to Folder" to display the
invisible ".ssh" folder contains the public key.

[![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/books/mac_key_2_e.jpg){:.w400}]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/books/mac_key_2_e.jpg "Go to Folder"){: .group1}

In the "Go to Folder" window, enter the path to the ".ssh" folder under
your home.

[![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/books/mac_key_3_e.jpg){:.w400}]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/books/mac_key_3_e.jpg "Enter the path to the .ssh folder"){: .group1}

The public key file "id_rsa.pub" is displayed.

[![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/books/mac_key_4_e.jpg){:.w400}]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/books/mac_key_4_e.jpg "Public key file in .ssh folder"){: .group1}

Copy the public key file "id_rsa.pub" to your desk top for your account
registration.

To distinguish the key pair, please save the JGA [public and private key pair for data decryption](/jga/download-e.html#key-for-decryption) as filenamaes having the applicatio ID by using -f option.
```
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -f J-DU999991
