## Metadata registration {#metadata}

The [DRA metadata](/dra/metadata-e.html) are composed of objects ([Examples of metadata organization](/dra/example-e.html)). External BioProject and BioSample records are referenced from DRA.

* Submission (DRA)
* BioProject
* BioSample
* Experiment (DRA)
* Run (DRA)
* Analysis (DRA, optional)

Please submit metadata in either of two ways, "Register metadata by using the web tool" or "[Register metadata by using the excel](#excel)". The excel is recommended for a large-scale submission.

Metadata submission by using the web tool is explained below.

Move to the submission page from the submission ID link (e.g. test07-0040).

{% include image.html url="books/hdra02.jpg" caption="Move to the submission page" class="w500" %}

Run the metadata submission tool at [Enter/Update metadata].

{% include image.html url="books/hdra03.jpg" caption="Run the metadata submission tool" class="w500" %}

When no file is uploaded, following message is displayed. [Upload data files](/upload-e.html) before submitting metadata.

{% include image.html url="books/hdra-not-uploaded.jpg" caption="The message displayed when no data file is uploaded." class="w300" %}

Enter metadata fileds in English. 
Required items are marked with <span class="red">*</span>. 
The content is checked every time you click the [Save] or when moving to the other tab. When error messages are displayed, revise the content.

The web tool supports metadata input in the tab-delimited text (tsv) file. Please see the [metadata tsv sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DTdUQ-WWOMjOA2eYQWmFYUB24hJysuwhvHLJoDFX4rc) for examples.

### Experiment {#experiment}

The same number of Experiment and Run as the BioSamples are created. Each BioSample-Experiment-Run are referenced. 
The Experiment and Run are automatically generated when the Experiment tab is first displayed.

Auto-generation of Experiments and Runs after selecting three BioSamples.

| BioProject | - BioSample (1) | - Experiment (1) | - Run (1) |
|            | - BioSample (2) | - Experiment (2) | - Run (2) |
|            | - BioSample (3) | - Experiment (3) | - Run (3) |

Add an Experiment by [Add new Experiment(s)]. 
Delete an Experiment by [Delete]. 
An Experiment referenced by a Run cannot be deleted.

{% include image.html url="books/hdra-experiment01.jpg" caption="Experiments reference the BioSamples, are automatically generated" class="w500" %}

Experiments can be entered by using a tab-delimited text (tsv) file. 
First save and fix Aliases (names of objects before accession number assignment, e.g. test07-0040_Experiment_0001-0003) by [Save]. Then download content into a tsv file by [Download TSV file].

{% include image.html url="books/hdra-experiment02.jpg" caption="Save, fix aliases and download as a tsv file" class="w500" %}

Enter metadata by using a spreadsheet software such as Excel.

If the "Title" is empty, it is automatically constructed as
"[Sequencing Instrument Model] [paired end] sequencing of [BioSample ID]" (e.g., "Illumina HiSeq 2000 paired end sequencing of SAMD00025741"). It is recommended to provide a user-defined title in "Title".   
Reference samples in "BioSample Used" by their SAMD accessions (example, SAMD00000001) or "SSUB BioSample Submission ID" : "Sample name" (example, SSUB003746 : Genome bacteria strain A). Spaces around ":" are ignored.

{% include image.html url="books/hdra-experiment03.jpg" caption="Experiment tsv file" class="w500" %}

Save enterted content as a tsv file and select and upload it by [Upload TSV file].

{% include image.html url="books/hdra-experiment04.jpg" caption="Upload Experiment as a tsv file" class="w500" %}

### Run {#run}

The same number of Runs as Experiments are created, and each Run references each Experiment.  
In the example, three Runs are created, and each Run references each Experiment.  
Add a Run by [Add another Run(s)].
Delete a Run by [Delete]. A Run linked to files cannot be deleted.

{% include image.html url="books/hdra-run01.jpg" caption="Save and fix Aliases" class="w500" %}

After fixing aliases by [Save], the run content is downloaded into a tsv file. To distinguish the data files, enter "Run" in the leftmost "Run/Analysis" field.

Click [Select data files for Run] and link the uploaded files to Run.

{% include image.html url="books/hdra-run02.jpg" caption="Move to next page to associate files to Run" class="w500" %}

All files uploaded to the submission directory are displayed. Associate a
file to a Run by selecting a Run alias in "Run/Analysis contains files".

Enter [File type](/dra/metadata-e.html#File_Type) and [MD5 Checksum](/checksum-e.html) of the files. 
File information can be entered by uploading a tsv file.

<div class="attention">
Paired-end data files must be included in a Run. Paired reads are recognized by their read names. The data files in a Run are merged and converted to a sra/fastq file.
</div>

{% include image.html url="books/hdra-runfinish.jpg" caption="Enter file attributes and link files to Runs" class="w500" %}

When an Analysis (optional) is not necessary, submit metadata by [Submit/Update DRA metadata].

{% include image.html url="books/hdra-submit01.jpg" caption="Submit DRA metadata" class="w500" %}

After submitting the metadata, validate the data files. Click the link "Validate uploaded data files to finish this submission".

{% include image.html url="books/hdra-submit02.jpg" caption="Start data file validation after submitting the metadata" class="w500" %}

### Analysis (optional)  {#analysis}

You may submit data files derived from raw reads to Analysis when there is no appropriate database to submit the derived data. Please note that Analysis is not shared with NCBI and EBI.  
Please check appropriate databases in "[Submission Navigation](/submission-navigation-e.html)" and "[Databases and Data Submission Systems](/submission-e.html)".

Create Analyses and enter their content. Unnecessary Analysis can be deleted by [Delete].

Click [Select data files for Analysis] and link files to Analysis.

{% include image.html url="books/hdra-analysis01.jpg" caption="Enter Analysis content" class="w500" %}

Enter file attributes and associate them with Analysis. When entering
file attributes by uploading a tsv file, enter "Analysis" in the leftmost "Run/Analysis" field to mark the files for Analysis.

{% include image.html url="books/hdra-analysisfile01.jpg" caption="Enter file attributes and associate the files to Analysis" class="w500" %}

Submit DRA metadata by [Submit/Update DRA metadata] and
proceed to data validation process. Only MD5 of analysis files are checked during the data file validation.

<div class="attention">
Please use the [Analysis metadata excel](/dra/analysis-e.html) for large-scale submissions.
</div>

### Excel-based submission {#excel}

Compared to the web tool, you can register metadata by once uploading XML files and can avoid web page transitions.  
Before filling in the excel, you need to finish the followings.

* [BioProject submission](#bioproject)
* [BioSample submission](#biosample)
* [Create a new DRA submission](#new-submission)
* [Upload data files](#upload)

Download the [DRA metadata excel](https://github.com/ddbj/submission-excel2xml/raw/main/metadata_dra.xlsx) and describe your metadata.  
Next, generate XML files by command lines as follows.   

Send the excel with the DRA submission ID by an [email attachment](mailto:trace@ddbj.nig.ac.jp) if you are not familiar with command line operations. We generate XMLs and register them instead of you. Please check the metadata and proceed to the [data file validation step](#validation).   

Generate Submission, Experiment and Run XMLs by using the command line tool according to [GitHub](https://github.com/ddbj/submission-excel2xml).  

To add XML elements not covered by the web tool nor the excel such as technical reads, please refer to [metadata XML examples](/dra/example-xml-e.html).

Login [D-way](https://ddbj.nig.ac.jp/D-way) and move to the DRA submission page. 
Following is an example of uploading the Submission/Experiment/Run XMLs to the DRA submission "test07-0040".

{% include image.html url="books/hdra-xmlupload.jpg" caption="Upload XML files" class="w500" %}

## Data file validation {#validation}

Checksum, format and content of the data files are validated. 
In "Data Files", filenames and md5 values of the metadata and the uploaded files are displayed.   
[Validate data files] is clickable when all files described in the metadata have been uploaded. Uploaded files not described in the metadata are ignored.   

Click [Validate data files] and validate the uploaded files.

{% include image.html url="books/hdra-validate.jpg" caption="Start data file validation" class="w500" %}

### MD5 Check {#md5}

Matching between the MD5 values in the metadata and those of the uploaded files is checked. Unmatch cause an error. The MD5 value of the file in your local computer are the same with that of the metadata, the file may be corrupted during the file transfer. Please re-upload the file. 
When the values in the metadata are wrong, revise the metadata at [Enter/Update metadata].

### Data Check {#check}

The file format and content are validated. If there is no errors, the submission status becomes "Submission Validated", and the files are moved to a separate directory.   
The DRA staff reviews the "Submission Validated" submission. Please do not touch the submission until the DRA staff contact you.

### Data Error {#data_error}

An error in the data file validation make the submission status "Data Error". 
Please see [FAQ: How to deal with validation errors in the DRA submission?](/faq/en/data-validation-error-e.html) regarding how to fix errors. [Stop validation] makes the submission back to "Metadata Submitted". Then revise the metadata and/or re-upload the files and start the data file validation again by [Validate data files].

{% include image.html url="books/hdra-error.jpg" caption="Stop validation" class="w500" %}

{% include image.html url="books/hdra-edit.jpg" caption="Revise submission" class="w500" %}

## Accession numbers {#accession}

When the metadata and the data files are complete, accession numbers are assigned to the metadata objects and informed to the submitter by email. The accession numbers are also displayed in the submission page.  

* Experiment (prefix DRX)
* Run (prefix DRR)
* Analysis (prefix DRZ)

Regarding how to cite the accession numbers, see "[FAQ: Which accession numbers should be cited in publication?](/faq/en/cite-accession-e.html)".

## Data release {#data-release}

Please see [DDBJ and SRA Data Processing](/data-processing-e.html) for data processing and status.   

The DRA submission is released according to our [data release policy](/policies-e.html#data-release). 
Please see "FAQ: [How are linked BioProject/BioSample/sequence data released?](/faq/en/bp-bs-seq-release-e.html)" regarding how linked data are released.  
After the release, the files are distributed at [ftp](https://ddbj.nig.ac.jp/public/ddbj_database/dra/), the metadata are indexed by [DDBJ Search](https://ddbj.nig.ac.jp/search) and the data are mirrored by [NCBI SRA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/) and [EBI SRA](https://ebi.ac.uk/ena) in a few days.

<div class="attention">
All data in a submission are released at the same time. If you want to release data at different time, please divide a submission.
</div>

## Access to registered files {#fastq-sra-files}

To allow the submitter to access and check the archived fastq/sra files, these files are copied to the directories of the submitter's area of the file server (ftp-private.ddbj.nig.ac.jp). To save the disk space, the copied files will be deleted in one month.

- /report/dra/(DRA submission accession)/fastq/
- /report/dra/(DRA submission accession)/sra/

Example: /report/dra/DRA000001/fastq/DRR000001.fastq.bz2

## Update {#update}

To change hold date, update metadata and add/delete data, please see [DRA Update](/dra/update-e.html).
