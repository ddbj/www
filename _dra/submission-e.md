[DDBJ Sequence Read Archive (DRA)](/index-e.html)is an archive database
for output data generated by next-generation sequencing machines
including Roche 454 GS System®, Illumina Genome Analyzer®, Applied
Biosystems SOLiD® System, and others. DRA is a member of the
[International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration
(INSDC)](/insdc-e.html)and archiving the data in a close collaboration
with [NCBI Sequence Read Archive
(SRA)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/sra.cgi)and [EBI Sequence
Read Archive (ERA)](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/).

Three INSDC partners regularly exchange data other than Analysis.

DRA accepts sequencing data from capillary sequencing platforms in fastq
format. To submit sequencing chromatograms in addition to bases and
qualities, please submit data to the [DDBJ Trace
Archive](/dta/index-e.html).

## Metadata <a name="metadata"></a>

### Metadata objects <a name="metadata-objects"></a>

The metadata describes how the associated data have been obtained. The
metadata are composed of 6 objects, [Submission](#Submission),
[BioProject](#BioProject), [BioSample](#BioSample),
[Experiment](#Experiment), [Run](#Run) and [Analysis](#Analysis). Each of
these objects is defined by its XML schema and is related each other.
Multiple Experiments can "point" to a single Sample, but not vice-versa.

Accession numbers with distinct prefixes are assigned to each object.
Metadata and accession number system are common in DRA/ERA/SRA. The
Experiment, Run and Analysis are the SRA objects, and the BioProject and
BioSample are external database objects.

For details, please see the [DRA XML
schema](https://github.com/ddbj/pub/tree/master/docs/dra)


[Submission](#Submission)  
: A container object only for grouping objects to be submitted.

[BioProject](#BioProject)  
: An overall description of a single research initiative; a project
will typically relate to multiple samples and datasets.

[BioSample](#BioSample)  
: Description of biological source material; each physically unique
specimen should be registered as a single BioSample with a unique
set of attributes.

[Experiment](#Experiment)  
: A description of sample-specific sequencing library and sequencing
methods. An Experiment references 1 BioProject and 1 BioSample.
Multiple Experiments can "point" to a single Sample, but not
vice-versa.

[Run](#Run)  
: Runs describe the files that belong to the previously created
Experiments. They specify the data files for a specific sample to be
processed by DRA. Note that all data files listed in a Run will be
merged into a single SRA archive file, so files from different
samples or replicates should not be grouped in the same Run.
Paired-end data files, conversely, MUST be listed in a single run in
order for the two files to be correctly processed as paired-end.

[Analysis](#Analysis)  
: Packages data associated with sequence read objects that are
intended for downstream usage or that otherwise needs an archival
home. Submit alignment data in bam file to Run. Please [contact to
DRA team to ask mirroring of analysis
data.](/contact-ddbj-e.html)Analysis files are provided on the DDBJ ftp
site and not indexed by the
[DRASearch](http://ddbj.nig.ac.jp/DRASearch).

  [A-Z,a-z,0-9], underscores [_], hyphens [-] and dots [.],
  with no whitespaces, brackets, other punctuations or symbols.
  - Barcoded data files should be demultiplexed prior to submission and
  a unique BioSample should be created for each barcoded sample; in
  other words, each BioSample must be linked to one or more unique
  data files.
  - In case of fastq files, submit paired reads in separate files. For
  bam and sff files, paired reads need to be described in single file.
  - Upload data files directly under a submission directory. Submitted
  archive files should NOT contain any directory structure.
  - Binary data formats, including BAM, SFF and HDF5 should be submitted without applying any additional compression.

### Formats of sequencing data files <a name="formats-sequencing-data-files"></a> 

The DRA metadata submission tool cannot describe technical reads
(adapter, primer and barcode sequences). "To submit raw data contain
technical reads" and "To use metadata elements in [DRA XML schema](https://github.com/ddbj/pub/tree/master/docs/dra) the but not in
the submission tool", [submitters need to create metadata in XML files](#create-metadata-in-xml-files)([XML examples](/ddbj/example.html)).

Generic formats

| Format           | Platform      | Recommended |
| ---------------- | ------------- | ----------- |
| [BAM](#BAM_file) | all platforms | Yes         |
| [fastq](#fastq)  | all platforms | Yes         |

Platform specific formats

### BAM file <a name="BAM_file"></a> 

Binary Alignment/Map files (BAM) represent one of the preferred DRA
submission formats. BAM is a compressed version of the Sequence
Alignment/Map (SAM) format (see
[SAMv1.pdf](https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/SAMv1.pdf)). BAM files
can be decompressed to a human-readable text format (SAM) using
SAM/BAM-specific utilities (e.g. [samtools](http://www.htslib.org/)) and can contain unaligned sequences as well. DRA recommends to submit BAM including unaligned reads as primary data into Run.

SAM is a tab-delimited format including both the raw read data and
information about the alignment of that read to a known reference
sequence(s). There are two main sections in a SAM file, the header and
the alignment (sequence read) sections, each of which are described
below. Note that this documentation will focus on a description of the
SAM format with respect to submission of BAM files to the DRA (i.e. DRA
doe not accept SAM files for submission). A more comprehensive
discussion of the format specifications can be found at the [samtools website](http://www.htslib.org/).

#### BAM file processing <a name="BAM_file_processing"></a>

The header and alignment section are internally consistent: each aligned read has an RNAME (reference sequence name, 3rd field) that matches an SN tag value from the header (e.g., CHROMOSOME_I), and, if provided,the alignment read group optional field (RG:Z:) is consistent with the
read group ID in the header (1). It is also important to ensure that the
FLAG fields (2nd field in each line) are correctly set for the data. The
SRA pipeline will attempt to resolve incorrect FLAG values, but
sufficiently incorrect values can lead to processing errors. The SRA
does not archive optional and non-standard tags/field values contained
in the alignment section. However, the entire header section of the bam
file is retained. Additionally, although the SAM format allows for an
equal sign (=) in the sequence field to represent a match to the
reference sequence or only an asterisk (*) in both the sequence and
quality fields, the DRA processing software does not recognize either of these formats.

Please note that unexpected notations used to indicated paired reads can lead to failure to recognize the pairs and an improper SRA archive (i.e.
paired reads are treated like fragments). For example, using :0 and :1
at the end of the read names is atypical and is currently not recognized
as an indication of read 1 and 2 in a pair. It would be better to
exclude these notations and provide the two reads with the same names.
Expected notations for particular platforms will work. For example,
Illumina reads with /1 or /2 appended is an expected notation. Further,
neglecting to set the proper bits for paired reads in the SAM/BAM flags
(e.g. multi-segment template 1-bit, first segment 64-bit, and last
segment 128-bit) or splitting paired reads into separate bam files can
result in an improper SRA archive or failure to generate the SRA
archive.

In the case of submitting alignment data, you need to submit "BAM",
"INSDC, refseq accession number OR reference multi-fasta" and
"SN-reference mapping table". Submit one bam file per Run.

When submitting bam file into Analysis instead of Run, the mapping table
is unnecessary. However, please consider to submit bam including
unaligned reads as primary data into Run.

<div class="attention red">
When submitting unmapped bam (without SQ header line) from PacBio and
IonTorrent, the mapping table and reference sequences are not necessary.
</div>

<div class="attention red">
If only BAM alignment files are submitted, then please make sure that
the BAM files also contain the unaligned reads. This is critical to
enable primary re-analysis and re-alignment of the dataset using new
tools or future genome assembilies.

1. #### BAM file submission <a name="BAM_file_submission"></a>
  The alignment data can be submitted in the BAM format. The bam files should be readable by [SAMtools](http://samtools.sourceforge.net/) and [picard](https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/). The BAM files are nearly optimal in terms of compression and should be submitted uncompressed.

2. #### Specify reference by INSDC/RefSeq accession number <a name="Specify_reference_by_INSDC/RefSeq_accession_number"></a>
  If references are found in [list]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/files/ref/ref-file.txt), references can be specified by their accession.version number (for example, NC_000001.11). [Version number](/ddbj/flat-file-e.html#Version)is necessary. Accession numbers for references can be searched in [NCBI Assembly](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/).

3. #### Specify reference by supplying multi-fasta <a name="Specify_reference_by_supplying_multi-fasta"></a>
  If references are not found in the [list]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/files/ref/ref-file.txt), submit a reference file in multi-fasta format. Select "reference_fasta" in the [Run file type](/dra/submission-e.html#File_Type). The reference name in the bam header and reference sequence are linked by the name in bam header and fasta defline via the mapping table. If sequence length is different between @SQ-LN and multi-fasta, a warning is raised.

4. #### Specify reference by both INSDC/RefSeq accession number and multi-fasta <a name="Specify_reference_by_both_INSDC/RefSeq_accession_number_and_multi-fasta"></a>
  If a part of references are found in [list]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/files/ref/ref-file.txt), these references can be specified by their accession.version number (for example, NC_000001.11). The rest of references needs to be supplied by uploading a multi-fasta file. In the SN-reference mapping table, list accession.version numbers and sequence names of multi-fasta deflines.

5. #### SN-reference mapping table <a name="SN-reference_mapping_table"></a>
  A tab delimited text file describing mapping between "SN in SQ line in BAM header" and "accession OR sequence name in fasta file". Select "tab" in the [Run file type](/dra/submission-e.html#File_Type)

  BAM header

```

corresponds to the SN:chr1.

```
chr1 NC_000001.11
chr2 NC_000002.12
chr3 NC_000003.12
...
```

### fastq <a name="fastq"></a> 

Run filetype needs to be specified depending on whether read length is
constant or not.

  - For the fastq files with constact read length, select 'fastq' in the
    [file type](#File_Type)of Run. Paired reads should appear in the
    same order in the paired files.
  - For the fastq files with variable read length, select
    'generic_fastq' in the [file type](#File_Type)of Run.


Format of fastq, for details, please see [NCBI
website](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK242622/#File_Format_Guide_BK.FASTQ).


  - Quality values must be in Phred scale. By default, 33 (!) is used
    for Phred quality offset. In the case of 64 (@), [update the
    ascii_offset of Run XML](#create-metadata-in-xml-files)to
    'ascii_offset="@"'.
  - In the DRA metadata submission web interface, technical reads (adapters, linkers, barcodes) cannot be described. When submitting fastq including technical reads, please describe technical reads in the Experiment XML according to [Formats of sequencing data files](#formats-sequencing-data-files) [(XML examples)](/ddbj/example-e.html). The Experiment XML submission is not necessary for fastq without technical reads.
  - Paired reads must split and submitted using two Fastq files. The
    read names must have a suffix identifying the first and second read
    from the pair, for example '/1' and '/2'.
  - The first line for each read must start with '@'.
  - The base calls and quality scores must be separated by a line
    starting with '+'.
  - The Fastq files must be compressed using gzip or bzip2.


### 454 <a name="454"></a> 

The DRA accepts sequencing run data from the 454 platform in the sff and
fastq/bam format. These files should reflect the sequencing run setup.
If a sff file contains data derived from more than one sample, please
break up resulting fastq file into files contain data from only one
sample.

The read names found in the *.sff*file are
meaningful and reflect the addressing scheme for the picotitre plate as
well as a globally unique run id. Please do not rewrite this name in the
sff as such addressing information will be lost. The sff file format is
nearly optimal in terms of footprint, so there is little to be gained by
further compressing them. Therefore, please provide
*.sff*files uncompressed.

### Illumina Genome Analyzer <a name="Illumina-Genome-Analyzer"></a>

#### Illumina pipeline v1.4 and later <a name="Illumina_pipeline_v1.4_and_later"></a>

DRA does not accept qseq files. Please convert qseq to fastq/bam.

### SOLiD <a name="SOLiD"></a> 

#### SOLiD Native Format <a name="SOLiD_Native_Format"></a>

DRA does not accept SOLiD native files. Please convert the native files
to fastq/bam.

### Ion Torrent <a name="Ion-Torrent"></a>

Submit Ion Torrent data in the sff or fastq/bam format.

### Helicos Heliscope <a name="Helicos-Heliscope"></a>

Submit Helicos data in the sms（helicos_native) or fastq/bam format
created with the fixed-quality value, "14".

### Complete Genomics <a name="Complete-Genomics"></a>

Submit Complete Genomics data in the fastq/bam format.

### Pacific Biosciences <a name="Pacific-Biosciences"></a>

#### HDF5 <a name="hdf5"></a>

Pacific Biosciences uses HDF5, a container file with a directory-like
structure, to store raw data. The DRA accepts both bas.h5 and bax.h5
file submissions. Note that submission of data from the RS II instrument
requires one Run consists of one *.bas.h5 file and three *.bax.h5
files. Do not rename files.

<div class="attention red">
Do NOT include files other than HDF5 in a Run.
</div>

#### bam <a name="pacbio_bam"></a>

We support the submission of the following types of PacBio bam files. Include 1 bam file per Run. For an unaligned bam file, reference and mapping table are not necessary.

  - subread BAM files (*.subreads.bam)
  - CCS read BAM files (*.ccs.bam)

#### fastq <a name="pacbio_fastq"></a>

The DRA also accepts Pacific Biosciences data in the
[fastq](#fastq) format. Because the read length varies, select the
["generic_fastq"](#fastq) for the Run filetype.

### Oxford Nanopore <a name="Oxford-Nanopore"></a>

Submit Oxford Nanopore data in the fastq/bam format.

### Capillary sequencing platform <a name="Capillary-sequencing-platform"></a>

Submit capillary sequencing data in the fastq/bam format.

## Analysis data files <a name="analysis-data-files"></a>

### PacBio Base Modification Files <a name="Pacbio-Base-Modification-Files"></a>

[PacBio](http://www.pacb.com)sequence data also permits the analysis of
methylated bases within the sequence, which can be extremely helpful to
the scientific community. For example, the precise positions of those
modified bases can be used to determine the specificity of the DNA
methyltransferases that produced them. The PacBio analysis suite
contains an analysis workflow (RS_Modification_and_Motif_Analysis)
to extract these sequences and produce several files:

  - motif_summary.csv
  - modifications.csv
  - modifications.gff
  - motifs.gff

It would be beneficial to the scientific community if you were able to
perform this analysis and submit at least the motif_summary.csv file
for prokaryotes via as a DRA Analysis object. Please submit these files
as data files of the Analysis with [Sequence Annotation
type](#Analysis_Type)in addition to sequencing reads in Run. For
assistance, [contact us](/contact-ddbj-e.html).

To submit genome assemblies to DDBJ, a unique [Locus tag
prefix](/ddbj/locus_tag-e.html) is necessary.

Locus tag prefix generation box will appear when [Project data
type="Genome Sequencing" or "Metagenome"] AND [Capture="Whole"] AND
[Objective="Sequence" or "Annotation" or "Assembly"]. Registration of
a unique locus tag prefix is required for studies that result in genome
assemblies.

The locus_tag prefix can contain only alpha-numeric characters and it
must be at least 3-12 characters long. It should start with a letter,
but numerals can be in the 2nd position or later in the string. (ex.
A1C). There should be no symbols, such as -_* in the prefix. The
locus_tag prefix is to be separated from the tag value by an underscore
‘_’, eg A1C_00001.

Please leave the prefix box empty, when a prefix is not necessary for
[WGS](/ddbj/wgs-e.html) only submission.

Prefix is managed by NCBI. When a project is submitted, our system tries
to reserve prefix to NCBI. When the prefix has already been reserved, an
error message will be displayed. Please enter a different prefix and
submit again.

<div class="attention red">
When multiple prefixes are necessary, please [contact

### Validation of data files <a name="validation-data-files"></a>

Submitted data files are converted to the SRA files for archiving.
During this conversion process, MD5 value, file format and integrity
between files and metadata are validated.

In the “Data Files”, filenames in the Run and Analysis, MD5 values in
the Run and Analysis and those of uploaded files, are displayed.

Click the [Validate data files] and validate uploaded data files.

{::nomarkdown}
{% include image.html url="books/hdra-validate.jpg" caption="UStart validationo of data files" class="w450" %}
{:/}

The files are validated in the following order.

[FAQ: How to deal with validation
errors?](/faq/en/data-validation-error)

#### MD5 Check <a name="MD5_Check"></a>

Consistency between the MD5 values in the metadata and of uploaded files
are checked. Inconsistency in the MD5 values cause errors. When MD5
errors occur, revise metadata and re-upload files.

#### Data Check <a name="Data_Check"></a>

Submitted data files are converted to the SRA files for archiving.
During this conversion process, MD5 value, file format and integrity
between files and metadata are validated. When errors occur, revise
metadata and re-upload files. Validation of large files takes time.

If no errors occur, submission status become "submission_validated",
and validated files are moved to separate directory.

The DRA staff review submissions with status "submission_validated".
Please do not touch submissions until the DRA staff contact submitters.

#### Revise a submission with "data_error" <a name="Revise_a_submission_with_"data_error""></a>

Any errors in the validation process make the submission status to
"data_error". Revise metadata and/or re-upload data files after
stopping the validation by clicking the [Stop validation] button.
After revision, click the [Validate data files] button and start
validation again.

### Accession numbers <a name="accession-numbers"></a>

When both the metadata and sequence data are validated (Status
“submission_validated”), accession numbers with the prefix DR
(Submission (DRA)，Experiment (DRX)，Run (DRR)，Analysis (DRZ)) are
assigned ("acc_issued", "complete" or "private"). Accession numbers are
displayed in the “Component”.

### Limited-time access to archived fastq/SRA files <a name="fastq-sra-files"></a>

To allow submitter to download and check archived fastq/SRA files, the
files are copied to the following directories on the
ftp-private.ddbj.nig.ac.jp server. To save disk space, the copied files
are automatically deleted in one month.

<div class="attention red">
Due to unexpected decrease of available disk space, copied fastq/SRA
files may be deleted within one month or the copy service may be
suspended. We will inform submitters on the website in advance as much
as possible, however, this annoucement could be immediately before the
deletion or service suspension.

### Data release <a name="data-release"></a>

After the registered data is loaded into the database, the Status
becomes “complete (private)” and the submission is kept private until
one of the following conditions are met.

<div class="attention red">
All data in a submission are released at the same time. If you want to
release data at different time, please divide a submission.
</div>

- A. Submitter requests to release their data.
- B. Submitter has published their accession number(s) and it has been
confirmed.  
We do not release the data when its accession number(s) has been
published wrongly by other than the submitter.  
"publish" means to disclose accession number(s) to the public
through paper, thesis, academic meeting, internet, press report etc.
- C. Specified hold-date has come.
- D. DDBJ/EMBL-Bank/GenBank records (e.g., [TSA](/ddbj/tsa-e.html),
[WGS](/ddbj/wgs-e.html), [CON](/ddbj/con-e.html)etc.) citing DRA Run
(DRR) accession number(s) have been made public.

Data are released without permission from submitters in the cases B, C
and D. In the case D, an entire DRA submission contains cited DRR Run(s)
is made public.

To immediately release the submission, click the [Release Now]. In the
middle of the night, the submission is released, data files will be made
available at [ftp](ftp://ftp.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/ddbj_database/dra/fastq/)and metadata will be indexed by the [DRA search system](http://ddbj.nig.ac.jp/DRASearch)in a few days.

### Update metadata <a name="update-metadata"></a>

Update metadata by clicking the [Enter / Update metadata] button. A
part of fields are blocked from editing. After editing your metadata,
please be sure to click the [Submit/Update DRA metadata] button and
reflect the updates to the DRA server.

### Add data files <a name="add-data-files"></a>

Data files cannot be directly added to the archived Run. In another DRA
submission, create new Experiment-Run objects referencing existing
BioProject and BioSample records to add data files.

Similar to Run, data files cannot be directly added to the archived
Analysis. To replace archived Analysis, please [contact to the DRA
team](/contact-ddbj-e.html).

Login [D-way](https://ddbj.nig.ac.jp/D-way/)and create a new submission
by clicking the [New submission]. Select the BioProject and BioSample
IDs to which data to be added. Next, add the DRA Experiment and Run
objects.

  - To add a new sample, share a BioProject ID and create a BioSample -
    Experiment - Run in a new DRA submission.
  - To add data files to existing sample, share BioProject and BioSample
    IDs and create an Experiment - Run in a new DRA submission.

Submit metadata and validate the appended data files. Accession numbers
will be issued to the appended Experiment/Run objects.

<div class="attention red">
The BioProject ID remains same, but different DRA submission number is
assigned.

## Supplement: MD5 <a name="supplement-md5"></a> 

MD5 (Message Digest Algorithm 5) is a hash function which calculates a
hash value (MD5 number, 32-digit numbers and letters) of a given file.
Because the MD5 number of the damaged file is distinct from the original
one, we can check whether the transferred file is intact or not by
comparing the numbers before and after the file transfer.
