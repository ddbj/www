## Analysis submission {#analysis}

[Analysis](/dra/metadata-e.html#Analysis) can be submitted in two ways.

* Small number: Submit at [the D-way web interface](/dra/submission-e.html#analysis).
* Large number: Download the metadata excel, fill in the file and generate Analysis XML and submit it. Or send the excel by email attachment. We generate Analysis XML(s) from the excel and upload them.

## Analysis metadata excel {#analysis-excel}

Fill in the metadata in Analysis sheet of [DRA metadata excel](https://github.com/ddbj/submission-excel2xml/blob/master/metadata_dra.xlsx).
Generate an Analysis XML according to [GitHub](https://github.com/ddbj/submission-excel2xml) and submit the [XML](/dra/submission-e.html#excel) in D-way. Or send the excel to the DRA team by email attachment. The DRA curator generates Analysis XMLs and upload them.
[Upload](/upload-e.html) analysis data files to DRA submission directory on the file server as DRA run data files.
