[DDBJ Sequence Read Archive (DRA)](/index-e.html) is the public archive
of high throughput sequencing data. DRA stores raw sequencing data and
alignment information to enhance reproducibility and facilitate new
discoveries through data analysis. DRA is a member of the [International
Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC)](/about/insdc-e.html) and
archiving the data in a close collaboration with [NCBI Sequence Read
Archive (SRA)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/sra.cgi) and [EBI
Sequence Read Archive (ERA)](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/).
