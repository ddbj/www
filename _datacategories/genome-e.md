# Data Submission from Genome Project

This page shows steps of genome sequencing, categories of sequence data
and their correspondences, briefly.  
The schematic diagram below indicates phases of typical genome
sequencing strategies.  
Also, please submit to [BioProject](/bioproject/index-e.html) and
[BioSample](/biosample/index-e.html), in case of large scale genome
sequencing project.

**Important:** [Data submission of human subjects
research](/policies-e.html#human)

See also [INSDC standards for genome assembly
submission](/ddbj/assembly-e.html).



[DRA] Raw outputs: data generated by next-generation sequencers  
: In case of output data generated by next-generation sequencing
platforms, submit to [DDBJ Sequence Read Archive
(DRA)](/dra/index-e.html).

[DTA] Chromatograms, Sequences, Qualities: data generated by
: sequencers based on Sanger method  
In case of single-pass reads of DNA sequence chromatograms (traces),
base calls, quality estimates, submit to [Trace Archive
(DTA)](/dta/index-e.html).

[WGS] Contigs: assemblies (overlapping reads)  
: In case of assemblies (i.e. overlapping reads) that are
appropriately assembled sequences excluded redundancy from raw
reads, submit to [Mass Submission System](/ddbj/mss-e.html) as
[WGS](/ddbj/wgs-e.html) data.

[HTG] draft sequences of large clones  
: In case of unfinished level, draft sequences of BAC, YAC or fosmid
clones, submit to [Mass Submission System](/ddbj/mss-e.html) as
[HTG](/ddbj/htg-e.html) data.

[CON] Scaffolds: supercontigs or clone tiling path  
: In cases of assembled sequences separated by gaps, so-called
supercontigs, and/or tiling path of large clones, submit to [Mass
Submission System](/ddbj/mss-e.html) as [CON](/ddbj/con-e.html)
data.

Finished genomic sequences  
: Submit to [Mass Submission System](/ddbj/mss-e.html) as general data
or complete genomes.
