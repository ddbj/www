## DDBJ Data Release

<div id="ddbj-release-growth-chart"></div>

<div id="ddbj-release-growth-table" class="top_space20"></div>
<br>

CON and TPA divisions are not included in the release statistics due to the following reasons. CON: CON division records are constructed from other sequence records and their inclusion would be a form of double-counting. TPA: TPA division records are not original data obtained by submitters.

Because very large-scale sequence data has been distributed by GenBank/ENA and DDBJ is not able to accomodate records with accession numbers in a new format, our latest release lacks large portion of GenBank/ENA's bulk sequence data.

Comment: 'Unique users/month' is 'unique IP addresses/month' (bot
accesses are excluded) generated by awstats. Due to the loss of web
server log of DDBJ home pages (www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp) from 2018-02-22 to
2018-04-13, the numbers of 2018 February, March and April are excluded
from 2018 average of 'Home pages' and 'All'. All is unique users/month
by combining and analyzing ARSA, BLAST, ClustalW, getentry, TXSearch,
DRASearch and www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp home pages (included in chart and
table), MiGAP, DDBJ Pipeline, D-way, BPSearch, BSSearch, SuperComputer
(sc.ddbj.nig.ac.jp) and home page (omitted in chart and table) logs.
'Home page' has been analyzed by the awstats 7.0 (since January 2004 to
January 2018) and awstats 7.2 (since February 2018), and all the other
sites have been analyzed by 7.2. Since October 2018, unique IP addresses
of the DDBJ website (www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp) and those of search, analysis
and submission web services have been merged.
