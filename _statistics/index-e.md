{: #ddbj-release}
## DDBJ data release

<div id="ddbj-release-growth-chart"></div>

<div id="ddbj-release-growth-table" class="top_space20"></div>
<br>

CON and TPA divisions are not included in the release statistics due to the following reasons. CON: CON division records are constructed from other sequence records and their inclusion would be a form of double-counting. TPA: TPA division records are not original data obtained by submitters.

Because very large-scale sequence data has been distributed by GenBank/ENA and DDBJ is not able to accomodate records with accession numbers in a new format, our latest release lacks large portion of GenBank/ENA's bulk sequence data.

Comment: 'Unique users/month' is 'unique IP addresses/month' (bot
accesses are excluded) generated by awstats. Due to the loss of web
server log of DDBJ home pages (www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp) from 2018-02-22 to
2018-04-13, the numbers of 2018 February, March and April are excluded
from 2018 average of 'Home pages' and 'All'. Until October 2021, all is unique users/month
by combining and analyzing ARSA, BLAST, ClustalW, getentry, TXSearch,
DRASearch and www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp home pages (included in chart and
table), MiGAP, DDBJ Pipeline, D-way, BPSearch, BSSearch, SuperComputer
(sc.ddbj.nig.ac.jp) and home page (omitted in chart and table) logs. In November 2021, BLAST, ClustalW and BP/BS/DRASearch were closed and DDBJ Search was released. Since November 2021, accesses to BLAST, ClustalW and BP/BS/DRASearch have been excluded and those to the DDBJ Search have been added. 'Home page' has been analyzed by the awstats 7.0 (since January 2004 to
January 2018) and awstats 7.2 (since February 2018), and all the other
sites have been analyzed by 7.2. Since October 2018, unique IP addresses
of the DDBJ website (www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp) and those of search, analysis
and submission web services have been merged.

Comment: 'Unique users/month' is 'unique IP addresses/month' (excluding bot accesses) of web accesses to www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp pages analyzed by awstats. The [awstats 7.0](https://awstats.sourceforge.io/docs/awstats_changelog.txt) (since January 2004 to January 2018) and [awstats 7.2](https://awstats.sourceforge.io/docs/awstats_changelog.txt) (since February 2018) have been used. In February 2018, BioProject/BioSample/DRA/GEA/JGA pages which had been hosted at trace.ddbj.nig.ac.jp addresses were integrated to www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp. Due to the loss of web access log from 2018-02-22 to 2018-04-13, the numbers of 2018 February, March and April are less than the actual and are excluded from 2018 year average.
